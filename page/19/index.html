          <section class="content"><p>The final technical integration to <code>make the blog a conversation</code> engine, is done. Can not imagine how far the blogging has come and how easy now it is to setup things. Yes can feel the new internet now. Remembering the back days, when I created a static <span class="caps">HTML</span> page and served through internet. Its a full circle now. Though the generation of the static pages are automated, but the thing is we are back to decentralised&nbsp;internet.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>First question to answer is <code>why I moved to a static page solution?</code>, there are a lot of answers to this.
Here is a nice writeup by David Tucker. <a href="http://davidtucker.net/articles/move-to-static-site-generator/">The Need for a Static Site Generator.</a><br>Now, since we know a static page site is the need of the time, the technology choice is important too. Obviously the first thing, that comes to mind is <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, yeah, its simple and just works. Being in <span class="caps">MAC</span>, its even tempting to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, as <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> comes installed with the <span class="caps">OS</span>. Further more <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> support is in-built with <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">GitHub Pages</a>. It could have been as simple as that.<br>I choose Javascript as the language of choice, since its exciting now, what we could do with it, so this blog would be one of my playgrounds for the work I do. I have already getting more and more familiar with <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> templating engine and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodeJS</a> workflows, <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">wintersmith</a> is such a nice engine which works on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodeJS</a>. Just the matter of time, as how far Javascript has&nbsp;come!   </p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding</p>

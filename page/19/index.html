            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/36/">Making a RESTful API with NodeJS and Express</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Here we will be making a basic <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> using the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>. I am not going in detail of how <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> works, but straight to the code, which is as below. While this may look as a regular <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> application, the important thing is the <span class="caps">API</span> can be called from any web<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>server.      </p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/saumya/402d2f035b23d7d08877.js"></script>
<p>While developing APIs, the first thing came to me is, how to call this from another server?! For thats the only reason we are exposing the <span class="caps">API</span>. And the answer is enable <a href="http://enable-cors.org/"><span class="caps">CORS</span></a>, cross-origin resource sharing. It simply means, make the <span class="caps">API</span> available or expose to these servers. we can specify the domain names individually or in this partcular case, we have exposed the <span class="caps">API</span> to any sever by specifying *<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>.       </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.all(<span class="string">'*'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">req, res, next</span>) </span>{
  res.header(<span class="string">"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"</span>, <span class="string">"*"</span>);
  res.header(<span class="string">"Access-Control-Allow-Headers"</span>, <span class="string">"X-Requested-With"</span>);
  next();
 });</code></pre>
<p>This means, upon any <span class="caps">API</span> call, add these headers first. And the header says, its allowed from any <code>*</code> domain. So the result is, before the <span class="caps">API</span> call hits any route, it first comes into this <code>all</code> binding and sets the values and then goes to the respective<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>route.</p>
<p>Happy Noding.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/35/">NodeJS, HTML5, JQuery and what you may come across in an interview</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is not a surprise for me, but if you are new to the modern web development and working on Javascript stack, chances are that you come acrcoss these in everyday life. It may come from anywhere, your collegue, your senior, may be from an interviewer. But the cool thing is, you are right in those cases. All you have to do is ignore them and move on. I had seen this while working on Flash platform, when people were saying things about Flash and Flex. Now the platforms are changed but situation are<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>same.          </p>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS is a different<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</li>
<li>NodeJS is not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>javascript.</li>
<li>NodeJS is bad for not having X, which Y language<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>has</li>
<li>Jquery is a different<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</li>
<li>JQuery is not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>javascript.</li>
<li>JQuery is better than<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>javascript.</li>
<li><span class="caps">HTML5</span> is a programming<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</li>
<li><span class="caps">HTML5</span> is different from<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">HTML</span>.</li>
<li>Have you worked on <span class="caps">HTML5</span>? If yes, have you worked on<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">DOM</span>?</li>
</ul>
<p>While I could answer to all these in single lines but then the interpretation would be wrong.<br>The point is people coming from traditional languages like, Java and C# and still working on those, think they know all. I would suggest, please come out from that and even if you want to target <span class="caps">JVM</span>, use a modern language like <span class="caps">SCALA</span> instead. Well, if these guys try to code in a modern platform like NodeJS, they suddenly make the simple solution, to a complex process, as per the old knowledge they were having. Even the elegance of these new modern platforms like Ruby, NodeJS etc seem to be bad in their eyes. Well, the problem is these guys are sitting on top positions in traditional service based companies. So, if you join one of these companies, or even appear for interview in those companies, chances are you will come across these scenarios. The best part is, you are right and they are wrong. So no need to feel bad if they talk like that. Just ignore and move on but never leave learning.<br>Another big problem for working in frontend is, these conventional people think, they can do a better architecture in frontend too, just because they can use an <span class="caps">ORM</span> in backend. So all those frontend elegant solutions provided by modern stacks will be bent according to these guys to a point where the elegance becomes a pain for you as a frontend developer. They will talk that “we had done these before this way”. Common, that way is over, that time is gone. Now learn something from the modern stack developers and make an elegant backend. I have even seen, these backend guys mentoring ObjectiveC guys, how to do an iPhone Application architecture, without knowing the iOS environment. This is not specific to iOS, but any mobile platform in general. Web is not mobile and there are different considerations and architecture depending upon the platform. While the modern web stack has changed and you simply do not understand it, how you can mentor a mobile application developer! Talking of backends, these guys even think traditional databases are the best, no need to try any other. They even hesitate to try a NoSQL! Common! Thats backend, at least update yourelf there before coming to frontend. Ask any new modern stack web developer, they will blow your mind with the stuff like NoSQL to responsive web applications. Even the enterprise is shifting to modern stack, but these are people who hold on to the past.The end result is, everyone suffers. But again, if you are new to the scenario, then do not worry, they will learn from their mistakes and all these time you have to live with it. All these, for someone on top does not know how to deal with new technology.<br>My honest suggestion to all you people starting your career in web development is, learn from the web, there are plenty of brilliant tutorials and examples available online and move on. Better, if you can, shift to a company where they know, what they are doing, rather than what they used to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>do.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/34/">Understanding BackboneJS View Event, jQuery Event and trigger()</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The fun in working with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> is freedom. The library is so decoupled that, one can really do any kind of architecture for an application. This freedom will come in your way if you do not know what is happening behind. We will be focusing on ‘Event’ here.<br>Working with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> often involves working with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> too as a <span class="caps">DOM</span> manupilation library. When we work on <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">DOM</span>, in terms of <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> we are working on View. At this point we must understand, that this BackboneView can dispatch event and the <span class="caps">DOM</span> we are dealing with also is capable of dispatching event. The point to note here is event dispatched through <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> framework, does not bubble. Where as the default <span class="caps">DOM</span> events bubble. Well, since we generally work with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for <span class="caps">DOM</span> manupilation, events fired through <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> also has the same effect as <span class="caps">DOM</span> events, they bubble. Working with a <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> ViewObject, we deal with <code>el</code> of the ViewObject. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> also provides a <code>$el</code> on each view. Take a note of this <code>$el</code>, which is a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> object.<br>Dispatching an Event in <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> is done<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>as</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="comment">//somewhere inside the View</span>
<span class="keyword">this</span>.trigger(<span class="string">'myEvent'</span>,{<span class="string">'data'</span>:<span class="string">'myValue'</span>});</code></pre>
<p>The basic syntax for <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events-trigger">dispatching an event in BackboneJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>is</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">object.trigger(event, [*args]) </code></pre>
<p>Remember that the <code>second parameter</code> in the <code>trigger</code> is <code>data</code> to be passed to the event-handler. Registering the listener for the event will be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>as </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">this</span>.listenTo(<span class="keyword">this</span>.viewObject, <span class="string">'myEvent'</span>, <span class="keyword">this</span>.onMyEvent);</code></pre>
<p>Now writing a handler for this event will look<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>as</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="comment">//handler</span>
onMyEvent: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">eventdata</span>)</span>{
    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(eventdata);<span class="comment">//example: getting data from the event</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>So, we get the whole <code>data</code> ( passed to the <code>trigger()</code> method as second parameter ) , as the arguement to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>handler. </p>
<p>Now lets focus on the <span class="caps">DOM</span> event for the same scenario.
The dispatcher code will look<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>as</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">this</span>.$el.trigger(<span class="string">'myEvent'</span>,{<span class="string">'data'</span>:<span class="string">'myValue'</span>});</code></pre>
<p>Here, actually it seems that we are using <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> Event, but since we are dealing with <code>$el</code>, we are actually <a href="http://api.jquery.com/trigger/">triggering a <span class="caps">DOM</span> event through jQuery</a>. Since this is a <span class="caps">DOM</span> event, it has all the three phases in its life cycle; capture, target and bubble. So, we can really catch this event on a parent view of <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> and the code would be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>like </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">events: {
    <span class="string">'myEvent'</span>: <span class="string">'onMyEvent'</span> <span class="comment">//this is actually listening to <span class="caps">DOM</span> event</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>The handler code will look<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>as </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">onMyEvent : <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">event,data</span>)</span>{
    event.preventDefault();
    <span class="comment">//code as required by application</span>
    <span class="comment">//But, see the second arguement is actually 'data', passed to 'trigger()'</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">false</span>;
}</code></pre>
<p>Note the difference in event handler here. We have now two arguements and the second arguement is the <code>data</code> that is passed in to <code>trigger()</code> call above.
All that is to it is, how you <code>trigger</code> the event, from the two ways<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the [BackboneJS]<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>View</li>
<li>From the <span class="caps">DOM</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>element     </li>
</ol>
<p>And then, writing a proper event-handler for the respective<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Event.     </p>
<p>In <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a>, sometimes you need to deal with situations, where you just want to listen for events without knowing the other Views. That way de-coupling the application. There is Mediator design pattern to do a central event dispatching system for the whole <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> application. Then there is this little but powerful thing, called bubbling, already available to native<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">DOM</span>.      </p>
<p>Here are the links to the two trigger<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>methods;</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://api.jquery.com/trigger/">jQuery trigger</a></li>
<li><a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events-trigger">BackboneJS trigger</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Happy Bubbling.</p>

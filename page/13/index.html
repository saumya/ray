            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/55/">AngularJS 102</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is the part two of the study of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. The first part is <a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/39/">AngularJS 101</a>.
This is focused on the vary basic concepts of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> like how and where to write a <code>controller</code> or <code>directive</code> etc. The <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-102">sample project is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here</a>.          </p>
<p>First thing first, as of any Javascript framework, the nature of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is not different in terms of, where you should write what. This is understood, as Javascript itself is dynamic in nature. There are a lot of guidelines through out the web as to, which file to contain what. In the end it boils down to personal preference. So just go ahead and do some working samples of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>yours.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you need is <code>index.html</code> or some <code>.html</code> file, which will be your entry point to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>project.</li>
<li>Include all the Javascript files in this <code>index.html</code> file as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>needed</li>
<li><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> does not need <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, but if you are using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, you will need <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> library as the later uses it. So include them in the <code>index.html</code></li>
<li>Include the <span class="caps">CSS</span> framework files in the <code>index.html</code></li>
<li>All in all, include all the files necessary in the project in <code>index.html</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there are ways to minify and combine all of them in a single file and all those tricks. We can focus on them later. For the timebeing lets focus on how to build <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the end include your <code>application.js</code> file, which will be your application entry file. Name of the file is not relevant, you can name it<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the application could be written in a single Javascript file or the application could be divided to be written in different Javascript files, each having a particular scope of work. Whatever the case may be, just remember each Javascript file should be an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> appModule = angular.module(<span class="string">'app.Main'</span>,[<span class="string">"ngRoute"</span>,<span class="string">"ngResource"</span>]);
})();</code></pre>
<p>The general convention is to wrap each module inside an immediately invoking function, just not to pollute the global space of the Javascript. As in the example above, we are using <code>ngRoute</code> and <code>ngResource</code> in our module <code>app.Main</code>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each Javascript file should be an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Module</li>
<li>Each module can use another module as a dependency and that can be passed in as a parameter in the array as shown<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>above</li>
<li>By now, you must have noticed, the name of the Javascript file and the name of the module might be different. As long as we provide proper name as dependecy and proper name for the script src, it is all<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>good.          </li>
</ul>
<p>Actually in the example above, the dependent modules <code>ngRoute</code> and <code>ngResource</code> is not present in the <code>angular.js</code> Javascript file . These modules are written in separate Javascript files as modules. So we need to include <code>angular-route.js</code> and <code>angular-resource.js</code> in our <code>.html</code> file to use them, else it will through<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>error.       </p>
<pre><code class="language-html"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"js/lib/angular-1.4.7/angular.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"js/lib/angular-1.4.7/angular-route.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"js/lib/angular-1.4.7/angular-resource.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-102">Sample Project</a>.   
Lets define another module in a javascript file named <code>one.js</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
  <span class="keyword">var</span> mOne = angular.module(<span class="string">'module.one'</span>,[]);
})();</code></pre>
<p>Now lets expose a factory from this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
  <span class="keyword">var</span> mOne = angular.module(<span class="string">'module.one'</span>,[]);
  mOne.factory(<span class="string">'oneFactory'</span>,<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{
    <span class="keyword">var</span> service = {};
    <span class="keyword">return</span> service;
  });
})();</code></pre>
<p>To use this factory in our project. We have<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>to </p>
<ul>
<li>include the <code>one.js</code> in our html<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>file</li>
<li>add the module name <code>module.one</code> in our application entry<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>file          </li>
</ul>
<p>So the application entry file will look as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
  <span class="keyword">var</span> appModule = angular.module(<span class="string">'app.Main'</span>,[<span class="string">"ngRoute"</span>,<span class="string">"ngResource"</span>,<span class="string">"module.one"</span>]);
  <span class="comment">// Now, we can use 'oneFactory' here, as its exposed by 'module.one'</span>
})();</code></pre>
<p>Each Javascript file should be an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>module.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each module could expose any number of anything. That means, any module could expose more than one Object. Those Objects could be any <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngluarJS</a> Object types, such as Controller, Factory, Service, Directive<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>etc.</li>
<li>As long as we are providing a dependency of the module name in the Array and refering the proper name of the Objects, we can use<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>them.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Directives</code> in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> are <code>visual elements</code>. They define custom <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags/elements as per their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>definition.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-102">Sample Project</a> and that should clear a lot of things, which might seem unclear here. <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is modular in the sense, there are carefully separated modules for different purposes. When in need, we include those Javascript files and add the dependecies in the Array. The same goes for our own modules. Try to separate out functionalities into their own modules and use it when<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>needed.   </p>
<p>Hopefully that will get you started with the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>framework.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/54/">A year with DOJO Toolkit.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>There are a number of reasons to use a specific framework in a work environment. But sometimes it boils down to just the hype. For example in recent past almost all the companies are trying to implement <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and before that time it was the time for <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> and the story goes on like that. It is always a good experience to work in very different kind of framework or for that matter its even better to work in different kind of languages<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>altogether.          </p>
<p>The last year was <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> Toolkit</a> year for me. I must say I am impressed to see features it provides and now that its moving in the right direction. For a long time now, this toolkit was just stagnant but last year only they have started moving again. Well, if you come from a <code>pure Javascript</code> background might not like it by the way it is designed and behaves. The <span class="caps">UI</span> layer of the <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> Toolkit</a> named as Dijit will seem like Flex components (If you know what Flash and Flex is, you will get what I am saying). The framework itself is designed to make people comfortable, who are used to Classical programming languages like <span class="caps">JAVA</span>. The whole toolkit will show itself, as a class based toolkit. The average user will just think and use it as a Classical programming language, which is the root of all evil things in a project. Thats part of the team and how it works with this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>toolkit.          </p>
<p>In general if we talk about the features this toolkit gives us, I would say its nice and efficient if we use it the way it is meant to. The next version is already on progress and they are moving to <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, that a nice move. All in all its a nice experience working with this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>framework.     </p>

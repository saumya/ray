            <h2><a href="http://localhost:1234/articles/11/">BackboneJS, view and its events</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Working in <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> is fun and easy to begin with. Slowly but steadily it gets complicated as we move on and add more to the project. Being said that, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> is not at all opinionated. So there is no rightway of doing something. If your solution works for your project, then its good to go. Well, then there are certain things, which may help you, better organise your code. One of such things is <code>View Events</code>.     
In a Backbone view, to listen to events and handle them, the general syntax is as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">events:{
        <span class="string">"click"</span>: <span class="string">"onClick"</span>
        },
<span class="attr">onClick</span>: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">event</span>)</span>{
    <span class="comment">//Do something with the event</span>
    <span class="comment">//or</span>
    <span class="comment">//specifically do it for a target</span>
    <span class="keyword">var</span> btnID = event.target.id;
    <span class="keyword">if</span>(btnID===<span class="string">'btn_one'</span>){
        <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'<span class="caps">TODO</span>:'</span>);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Well, it may be easier at first, but we are listening for events for the whole view and then in the handler checking it. There is a way in <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> that directly and listens for events for that particular target. The code looks as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">events:{
        <span class="string">"click #btn_one"</span>: <span class="string">"onClick"</span>
        },
<span class="attr">onClick</span>: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">event</span>)</span>{
    <span class="comment">//btn_one is clicked</span>
    <span class="comment">//Do something with the event</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>Happy coding.      </p>

            <h2><a href="http://localhost:1234/articles/10/">Distribute iOS app on your web site</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Its not that difficult as it sounds.<br>First of all, there are distribution services out there. I am not going to name them here, but they are available. A simple web search will show you that. 
Now, the question is, how do they do it, or the more significant question is, can we do it ourselves. The answer is yes.
There are 3 basic things required for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>.ipa file ( iOS app<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>)</li>
<li>.plist file ( manifest file for the app<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>)</li>
<li>.html file ( html file for showing the link to the user<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The iOS app must be compiled with the Ad-<span class="caps">HOC</span> distribution certificate with the device(where the app will be installed) UDIDs included. Thats the same procedure, as one would follow, while distributing through other stores. Once its compiled, you say <code>Archive for distribution</code> in XCode, which will create the <code>.ipa</code> file. The manifest file defines the application meta data, if you go through the manifest file below, there is a place to point to the <code>.ipa</code> file, make sure, you provide <code>full URL to .ipa</code> file. The download link on <span class="caps">HTML</span> file will point to this manifest file. Here is the boilerplate for a typical manifest file (which is a .plist file). The <span class="caps">HTML</span> file, is simply  having a link pointing to the <code>.plist</code> file.     </p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/saumya/8440357.js"></script>     
<p>Now simply link to the plist file in the <span class="caps">HTML</span> file as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;a href=&quot;itms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=https://myServer/iOS-dist/iOSAppDist.plist&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Install My App&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p>Now visit the <span class="caps">URL</span> through iPhone, where your <span class="caps">HTML</span> file is stored. Once you click the link, it will download and install the iOS<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>app.</p>
<p>Happy hacking.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://localhost:1234/articles/9/">HTML5, requestAnimationFrame</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Making a javascript application, at somepoint, involves use of <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> functions. Well, the possibility increases even more, when one needs to animate elements. So we know what it means to use these two functions.<br>Fortunately we have a new method, called <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code>, which is elegant and effective. Now animations will not eat up mobile battery life, but still be smooth. This is optimised to takecare of the host environment, such as mobile browser, desktop browser etc. It even minimises the repeat call, if the application using it, is not visible or scrolled out of view, sweet.<br><a href="http://caniuse.com/requestanimationframe">Check, which browsers and versions support this function,</a> just to make yourself clear.<br>Here are few links which explain <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> function in more<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>detail.    </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame">mozilla</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/">Paul Irish</a></li>
<li><a href="http://creativejs.com/resources/requestanimationframe/">Creative <span class="caps">JS</span></a>   </li>
</ul>
<p>Its kind of <code>saying bye bye</code> to <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code>.    
Happy Animating.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/29/">Amazon S3, file system.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I had my hands dirty for the first time, in last couple of days, with Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). I was playing with the javascript <span class="caps">SDK</span> and getting to know the environment in general. The first impression is, it just stores the files and folders. But, digging deep inside and playing with its APIs, made me realise that its different than the traditional storage.<br><code>Everything is just a pointer</code>, well thats how I see it.<br>Amazon says, everything is a file. So that means a folder is a file with a different naming convention. Thats it, if you get that, then the <span class="caps">API</span> is straight forward. And I must say from the beginning of the computer era, one thing has been consistent and that is file system. Now, the way, new storage solutions are emerging, it’s not actually different from others’ offers, but definitely different from traditional file systems. The new era of the file systems or more generally we can say data storage systems are emerging and Amazon is no different in that regard. So, all in all, a new storage system with a very simple SDK is&nbsp;exciting.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/28/">jQuery Mobile, making change page work.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The <a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/24/">last post</a> about the <a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/24/">change page</a> <span class="caps">API</span> change of <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> tells you as to, how to change a page, in the <a href="http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/">new <span class="caps">API</span></a>. I was hoping thats the only change, but there seems, some kind of fix necessary to make a page, change properly. I mean, there is this bug, where the page change actually does this. It goes to the page mentioned by the change page and then it comes back to the page again, from where it was moved. So the effect is, the page is not chaged at all and the user looks at a screen, where the application simply moves to another screen and comesback to the original screen.<br>For me the fix that worked is send <code>changeHash:true</code> in the options object of the&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>.     </p>

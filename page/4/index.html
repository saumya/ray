          <section class="content"><p>First question to answer is <code>why I moved to a static page solution?</code>, there are a lot of answers to this.
Here is a nice writeup by David Tucker. <a href="http://davidtucker.net/articles/move-to-static-site-generator/">The Need for a Static Site Generator.</a><br>Now, since we know a static page site is the need of the time, the technology choice is important too. Obviously the first thing, that comes to mind is <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, yeah, its simple and just works. Being in <span class="caps">MAC</span>, its even tempting to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, as <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> comes installed with the <span class="caps">OS</span>. Further more <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> support is in-built with <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">GitHub Pages</a>. It could have been as simple as that.<br>I choose Javascript as the language of choice, since its exciting now, what we could do with it, so this blog would be one of my playgrounds for the work I do. I have already getting more and more familiar with <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> templating engine and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodeJS</a> workflows, <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">wintersmith</a> is such a nice engine which works on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodeJS</a>. Just the matter of time, as how far Javascript has&nbsp;come!   </p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding</p>

          <section class="content"><p>After a week of searching, studying and re-searching things, finally landed up with this.
Well, there is not much to <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">wintersmith</a>, it 10 mins job at max if someone has a little experience in NodeJS.The main delay for me was to trying to produce a static site out of my old blog, which was running in <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>&nbsp;eninge.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

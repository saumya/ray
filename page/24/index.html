            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/37/">Upgrading to Ruby 2.x from 1.x with rvm, on an upgrade from old OSX to Mavericks.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is a situation when you have updated the <span class="caps">OS</span> from a previous version of Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span> to the latest version of the <span class="caps">OSX</span> Mavericks. Generally <span class="caps">OSX</span> ships with a version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, which is latest by the time the <span class="caps">OS</span> is released. But when it comes to <span class="caps">OSX</span> upgrade and in this case particularly to <span class="caps">OSX</span> Mavericks, the operating system upgrade does not bring in the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> upgrade. Rather, the old <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> lives on the new <span class="caps">OSX</span>. Well, if you have a decent understanding of managing <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> versions, you may be using one of the version management systems of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. I used to have <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. Now I have an upgraded <span class="caps">OSX</span> but need to have the latest version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. The steps are as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below     </p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a></li>
<li>Upgrade <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Well, there are issues with these two steps as I found throughout the net. A simple search in the internet will make you aware of this fact. So the refined steps are as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install XCode Commandline<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tools</li>
<li>Reinstall <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a></li>
<li>Upgrade <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In my case, I do not have to install the XCode commandline tools, probably because I am an iOS developer and always updates to the latest version of XCode along with the commandline tools. The thing to note here is with the <span class="caps">OSX</span> upgrade, the commandline tools of XCode is removed by the system. Even if, one installs the new <code>XCode</code>, the <code>commandline tools</code> are not included by default. All one has to do is <code>install</code> it (<code>again</code>).<br>Moving on, the next step is to upgrade the <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. With the <span class="caps">OSX</span> upgrade, the normal <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a> update does not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>work.</p>
<pre><code>rvm get stable</code></pre><p>So, the fix is to <code>install rvm</code> (you can call it <code>again</code>) as below.</p>
<pre><code>\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable</code></pre><p>Once this step is done everything else is just normal <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> update thing. Update <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> with the commad as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<pre><code>rvm install ruby-2.1.1</code></pre><p>Now lets install a gem such as json, which can be done with the command as follows. I was suggesting <del>sudo gem install json</del>, but never do that. Instead<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>use</p>
<pre><code>gem install json</code></pre><p>It seems using <code>sudo</code> <code>is not advisable</code> to be used while using <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. I got a reply in twitter for this blog post, from <a href="https://twitter.com/rvm_io">@rvm_io</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>as </p>
<blockquote>
<p>looks good, the only hint - never use sudo with <span class="caps">RVM</span>, sudo “disables” <span class="caps">RVM</span> controlled ruby, the gem most likely is installed in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>system    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thats all to it. The important thing is, if we try to install the 2.x version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> with old <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, it will not work. Actually, it does not show even in the known list of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>Happy upgrading.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/36/">Making a RESTful API with NodeJS and Express</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Here we will be making a basic <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> using the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>. I am not going in detail of how <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> works, but straight to the code, which is as below. While this may look as a regular <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> application, the important thing is the <span class="caps">API</span> can be called from any web<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>server.      </p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/saumya/402d2f035b23d7d08877.js"></script>
<p>While developing APIs, the first thing came to me is, how to call this from another server?! For thats the only reason we are exposing the <span class="caps">API</span>. And the answer is enable <a href="http://enable-cors.org/"><span class="caps">CORS</span></a>, cross-origin resource sharing. It simply means, make the <span class="caps">API</span> available or expose to these servers. we can specify the domain names individually or in this partcular case, we have exposed the <span class="caps">API</span> to any sever by specifying *<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>.       </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.all(<span class="string">'*'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">req, res, next</span>) </span>{
  res.header(<span class="string">"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"</span>, <span class="string">"*"</span>);
  res.header(<span class="string">"Access-Control-Allow-Headers"</span>, <span class="string">"X-Requested-With"</span>);
  next();
 });</code></pre>
<p>This means, upon any <span class="caps">API</span> call, add these headers first. And the header says, its allowed from any <code>*</code> domain. So the result is, before the <span class="caps">API</span> call hits any route, it first comes into this <code>all</code> binding and sets the values and then goes to the respective<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>route.</p>
<p>Happy Noding.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/35/">NodeJS, HTML5, JQuery and what you may come across in an interview</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is not a surprise for me, but if you are new to the modern web development and working on Javascript stack, chances are that you come acrcoss these in everyday life. It may come from anywhere, your collegue, your senior, may be from an interviewer. But the cool thing is, you are right in those cases. All you have to do is ignore them and move on. I had seen this while working on Flash platform, when people were saying things about Flash and Flex. Now the platforms are changed but situation are<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>same.          </p>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS is a different<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</li>
<li>NodeJS is not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>javascript.</li>
<li>NodeJS is bad for not having X, which Y language<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>has</li>
<li>Jquery is a different<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</li>
<li>JQuery is not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>javascript.</li>
<li>JQuery is better than<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>javascript.</li>
<li><span class="caps">HTML5</span> is a programming<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language.</li>
<li><span class="caps">HTML5</span> is different from<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">HTML</span>.</li>
<li>Have you worked on <span class="caps">HTML5</span>? If yes, have you worked on<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span><span class="caps">DOM</span>?</li>
</ul>
<p>While I could answer to all these in single lines but then the interpretation would be wrong.<br>The point is people coming from traditional languages like, Java and C# and still working on those, think they know all. I would suggest, please come out from that and even if you want to target <span class="caps">JVM</span>, use a modern language like <span class="caps">SCALA</span> instead. Well, if these guys try to code in a modern platform like NodeJS, they suddenly make the simple solution, to a complex process, as per the old knowledge they were having. Even the elegance of these new modern platforms like Ruby, NodeJS etc seem to be bad in their eyes. Well, the problem is these guys are sitting on top positions in traditional service based companies. So, if you join one of these companies, or even appear for interview in those companies, chances are you will come across these scenarios. The best part is, you are right and they are wrong. So no need to feel bad if they talk like that. Just ignore and move on but never leave learning.<br>Another big problem for working in frontend is, these conventional people think, they can do a better architecture in frontend too, just because they can use an <span class="caps">ORM</span> in backend. So all those frontend elegant solutions provided by modern stacks will be bent according to these guys to a point where the elegance becomes a pain for you as a frontend developer. They will talk that “we had done these before this way”. Common, that way is over, that time is gone. Now learn something from the modern stack developers and make an elegant backend. I have even seen, these backend guys mentoring ObjectiveC guys, how to do an iPhone Application architecture, without knowing the iOS environment. This is not specific to iOS, but any mobile platform in general. Web is not mobile and there are different considerations and architecture depending upon the platform. While the modern web stack has changed and you simply do not understand it, how you can mentor a mobile application developer! Talking of backends, these guys even think traditional databases are the best, no need to try any other. They even hesitate to try a NoSQL! Common! Thats backend, at least update yourelf there before coming to frontend. Ask any new modern stack web developer, they will blow your mind with the stuff like NoSQL to responsive web applications. Even the enterprise is shifting to modern stack, but these are people who hold on to the past.The end result is, everyone suffers. But again, if you are new to the scenario, then do not worry, they will learn from their mistakes and all these time you have to live with it. All these, for someone on top does not know how to deal with new technology.<br>My honest suggestion to all you people starting your career in web development is, learn from the web, there are plenty of brilliant tutorials and examples available online and move on. Better, if you can, shift to a company where they know, what they are doing, rather than what they used to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>do.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/40/">Checklist to join a corporate</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It is a surprise for me, to see the processes these companines follow to get a person on board. I am not talking about interview. The technical interview is kind of rounds after rounds of never ending interviews. But at least, these are ok-ish situation for a tech person.<br>The real pain starts, once you get through the interview. Now you are selected and need to serve the notice period at old organisation and move on to join the new one. The problem is, once you are through the interview, this new companies will call you at least 5 times a day. This is plain and simple irritating. They will force you (no one can force you, but at least they will talk like that) to join before the scheduled time. 
If at all, you have joined them by keeping their words, there would be no respect at all for that. Once you come to join them, they will show how much process they follow! Really?!! If you follow all these, why you kept on calling a person who has not joined you? Where were your processes! Or is that a process of yours to trouble someone, who is not from your organisation! Simple stupid. So you make your own process, follow your own process and change that at will.<br>Well, just keep in mind that once you have come to join a new corporate, keep below things with you. These companies will not tell you, when they should have, that please bring all these with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>you.     </p>
<ol>
<li>Your own laptop (only windows with Internet<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Explorer)</li>
<li>Your own datacard for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>internet</li>
<li>Your phone with roaming<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>activated   </li>
</ol>
<p>Once these are done, keep below things with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your cheque book</li>
<li>Your father’s identity<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>proof</li>
<li>All your previous residing locations<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>proof</li>
<li>Two friends’ addresses and contact from each of all previous location and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>company</li>
<li>Two local friends’ contacts and addresses (if they are not, create them<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Well last but most importantly keep “your common sense and simplicity” at home. Just rember that these are just mindless machines working for a factory which does not have and can not respect to have a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>brain.</p>
<p>Never giveup.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/39/">AngularJS 101</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It took me sometime to make me comfortable in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. There are a lot of tutorials, discussions and videos out there about <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. I would suggest, go through them and go through as many as you can, before jumping into code with this framework. We will be looking at the very basics of the framework here and for <code>version 1.3</code> and above, of the framework.<br>You must heard about <span class="caps">MVC</span> or Model-View-Controller architecture and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. While thats true, lets keep that for a little late.<br>First of all, just remember that <code>$scope</code> is model object and sometimes referred to as <code>ViewModel</code>. Then there are <code>Views</code>, which are either <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags or full html files. And then <code>Controllers</code>, which are javascript files. At this point always remember that <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> revolves arround these <code>View</code> and <code>Controller</code>. The data this <code>View</code> displays is the same as the data the <code>Controller</code> modifies and is available through <code>$scope</code>. No matter what, <code>$scope</code> remains in the middle as this<br><code>View &lt;---$scope---&gt; Controller</code><br>Now, since <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> already uses <code>2-way data binding</code> any changes to data or <code>$scope</code> in <code>View</code> or <code>Controller</code> is reflected by each other.<br>An <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> application begins with a module named <code>ng-app</code> and this <code>ng-app</code> is generally only one. So what is a module ? Module is kind of self contained small applications inside a big application. The special module <code>ng-app</code> is the only exception as its the big application and everything else in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> world happens inside it. All other modules generally go inside <code>ng-view</code>, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-101/blob/master/index.html">this html page</a> for the reference.In terms of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, a module is a combination of a <code>View-$scope-Controller</code>. Everytime you need to load this module, the View gets loaded in the <code>ng-view</code> and its Controller gets initialised along with the <code>$scope</code>. All these mapping are written in a <code>Route</code>, which maps <code>View with Controller</code>, <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-101/blob/master/js/saumyaApp.js">take a look at this</a>. Route is a separate module as of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> version 1.3. So, one need to include the <span class="caps">JS</span> file and the dependency. A quick reference of an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> application looks as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below        </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">HTML</span> page</li>
<li>ng-app (root module)</li>
<li>ng-view (sub modules load<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here)</li>
<li>first <span class="caps">JS</span> file for Route and other<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>things</li>
<li>Route maps <span class="caps">URL</span> paths with sub-views and their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>controllers</li>
<li>sub-views(<span class="caps">HTML</span> partials or pages) are loaded inside the ng-view and initialied with their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>controllers        </li>
</ul>
<p>So far we are good. The next thing is, we can still make it more modularised. <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> allows, something called as <code>Directives</code>, you may think of it as components. Inside a <code>Module</code>, we can write our custom directives, which are <code>custom HTML tags</code> along with its <code>controller</code>. But always remember, <code>Directives</code> are part of <code>View</code>. So the <code>$scope</code> is also available to them. Now, there are different pre-built modules with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> for different job in hand, like <code>$http</code> is for interacting with <code>web services</code>.         
<a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-101">Refer to the project here</a>, which I have created to better understand the basic of an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> application. Always remember, anything in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> that we write falls upon either <code>View</code> or <code>Controller</code> and there is always <code>$scope</code> available to both of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>these.        </p>
<p>I would love to listen your inputs on this, please leave a comment for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>discussion.         </p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>

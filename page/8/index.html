          <section class="content"><p>This came to me as a surprise that, in todayâ€™s world for web related work one has to work with <code>tables</code> as if its 1999. Well, I am talking about designing and developing for email newsletters. Here is a <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/design-and-build-an-email-newsletter-without-losing-your-mind/">tutorial from 2010</a> which still is relevant. So yes, if you have gone through the above tutorial you have already known, for the reference I will mention it again<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here. </p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Like most of the <span class="caps">PHP</span> frameworks, <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim framework</a> uses <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> for developer experience. <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> does a lot of things which manually one has to do before. This post is specifically with regard to <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim framework</a>. However, this can also be refered to, for other frameworks which use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/82/">Cake &amp; Slim</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><span class="caps">PHP</span> frameworks have really taken up some new concepts from other technology such as NodeJS and Ruby. On my search for an easy deployable framework to server, I found both <a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> and <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> are good<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>enough.</p>
<p>For getting started with development <a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> seems like old school as one just needs to download the package and put it on a server and get into coding. While <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> seems to be a little more learning as one needs to get used to <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>. <a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> also has an option to get started using <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> is a full framework having everything to get an application running on server. <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> seems to be a better option to get upto speed with <span class="caps">API</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>development.</p>

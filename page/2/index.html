          <section class="content"><p>Working on a local storage for persistence in data has a lot of solutions. While we can definitely go ahead and just store <code>String</code> values and play with it, Apple provides some solutions to play with local data as if its a database. The thing is, its not that intuitive. Other solutions are there, but the simplicity of <a href="https://realm.io/">Realm.io</a> is nice and&nbsp;addictive.            </p>
<p>Lets see how in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">swift</a> we could play with <a href="https://realm.io/">Realm</a>.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>While Apple has put a lot of design patterns to develop applications for iOS, the flexibility of an event driven application development surely has its merits. The very de-coupled application is so nice to play around with. Well, the downside is to find where is what. For a strictly coupled application, one can definitely find the root of the roots. But for a de-coupled application its very difficult to find what is happening where. Then comes good practices of code commeting and logger messages to rescue. That topic is a separate post I&nbsp;hope.            </p>
<p>Lets see how in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">swift</a> we could write an event driven&nbsp;application.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Developing for iDevices has come a long way. With the new and emerging tools everyday, the pain is also fading away. In the beginning I used to avoid any third party tools to help me build for iOS in ObjectiveC. Back then, both the XCode environment and the tools were emerging, so it was obvious to run into the edge cases very soon. The time has changed and so as the tools have matured.<br>

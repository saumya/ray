            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/45/">CoffeeScript basics</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Just to set the expectations right, we need to know something before we begin&nbsp;here.         </p>
<p>When I first heard about <code>Class</code> in <code>Javascript</code> it created curiosity on me and the expectation increased as to work like a <code>Classical</code> language(Where Classes are the root of everything) instead of <code>Prototypical</code> language(like Javascript). But then slowly I understood that its not <code>Javascript</code> but other languages on top of Javascript which create somekind of <code>Class</code> concept to mimic <code>Classical</code> languages. The point is everything boils down to <code>Javascript</code> if a language is written to compile or transpile to <code>Javascript</code> . Well, that may seem like a spoiler right now, but its actually not as we will see. Just keep these things in mind all the time, even if we are doing <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#top">CoffeeScript</a>.        </p>
<p>Here is the direct link to the <a href="https://github.com/saumya/CoffeeScript101">Github</a> repository for the code reference to this&nbsp;post.       </p>
<ul>
<li>CoffeeScript is generally written in a <code>.coffee</code> file</li>
<li>Each <code>.coffee</code> file is compiled to a <code>.js</code> file</li>
<li>Each space (a blank space) in code has a meaning in the <code>.coffee</code> file</li>
<li>Semicolons are optional and generally&nbsp;avoided</li>
<li>In the beginning you may write more than one classes in a single <code>.coffee</code> file, and thats perfectly alright&nbsp;here</li>
<li>By default the <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#top">CoffeeScript</a> Classes you write are&nbsp;private            </li>
</ul>
<p>When compiled to <span class="caps">JS</span>, the contents of each file, are put inside a self invoking function. This is intentional to not pollute the Global variables. So if the content has some classes inside them, then those classes will also be inside the self-invoking function, restricting the access from outside.<br>The classes in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#top">CoffeeScript</a> are compiled to as usual <span class="caps">JS</span> functions and the inheritence is done through the prototypical inheritence concepts of Javascript. Since all this happens behind the scenes and as a <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#top">CoffeeScript</a> developer if you do not know, how its working, it would be a pain later to expect anything else from this&nbsp;language.          </p>
<p>Thats all to start with the new year. Happy new&nbsp;year.         </p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/44/">RequireJS, Load timeout for modules!</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Working with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a>, will make you work with <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>. And if you are working with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> for a little time, then you probably know what I am talking about. Sometimes, the modules we are loading through <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> throw errors&nbsp;saying</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="built_in">Error</span>: Load timeout <span class="keyword">for</span> modules
</code></pre>
<p>I will suggest to have a look at <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html">RequireJS</a> documentation for detailed explanation.<br>The most common and which may hit you in the begining is the <code>timeout</code> for timeout itself. There are ways to fix this. The options&nbsp;are</p>
<ul>
<li>increase the timeout&nbsp;limit</li>
<li>reload the page or the module on timeout&nbsp;error</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> configuration has an option called <code>waitSeconds</code>, which defaults to <code>7</code>. Now if the module does not load in 7 seconds, it will giveup and throw the error. If <code>waitSeconds</code> is set to <code>0</code>, it will wait for <code>infinite</code>. Well, along with that setting, set the <code>enforceDefine</code> to <code>true</code> for reliability in all browsers and scenarios. This setting will look as&nbsp;below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">requirejs.config({
    enforceDefine: <span class="literal">true</span>,
    waitSeconds: <span class="number">0</span>,
</code></pre>
<p>Thats a quickfix. But again, it may hit the performace of the application.<br>The otherway is <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#errbacks">Errbacks</a> as per <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>. so what are they. They are simply callbacks but since it happens in errors, its called <code>Errbacks</code>. We can do stuff like reloading the whole application or the specified module or other error handling on&nbsp;these.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="built_in">require</span>([<span class="string">'modules/one'</span>,<span class="string">'modules/two'</span>],
           <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">One,Two</span>)</span>{
            <span class="comment">//Application logic</span>
        },
        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">error</span>)</span>{
            <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'Custom <span class="caps">ERROR</span> handler'</span>,error);
            <span class="comment">//error.requireModules : is Array of all failed modules</span>
            <span class="keyword">var</span> failedId = error.requireModules &amp;&amp; error.requireModules[<span class="number">0</span>];
            <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(failedId);
            <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(error.message);
        });
</code></pre>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/43/">Upgrading to Cordova 3.4 and above</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>While trying to upgrade, one of my previous Cordova Android application, to latest <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> , noticed that <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> now makes it very difficult to switch to a native development workflow. Its not the flow itself, which is difficult, but the information about the flow and to get started with a project which is the problem. If you have ever worked with the native development flow of <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> , which I guess you must have, as that was the actual flow in the beginning. Then its exactly the same work flow, but the thing is, its not mentioned anywhere. And in between these, they had introduced a web development workflow and tried forcing to use it. Which itself is not clear and then combined the native workflow with it. Good that, that period is over. But its not clear at all from the docs.
Well, first of all, <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> is saying its released the version 4 of the toolkit. When you go to <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/#download">download</a> section for native development workflow, you will <a href="https://www.apache.org/dist/cordova/">not find a version 4</a> ! So, you have to go inside <a href="https://www.apache.org/dist/cordova/platforms/">platforms</a>, there also you will not find version 4. So, I ended up downloading 3.6.4 for android and will suggest everyone to do that for the time being. After downloading the zipped file, extract it to a folder. Navigate to the folder and fireup the cordova create command to create a project.
Next is adding the plugins, because now <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> does not include plugins by default. For that, one has to go back to Cordova <span class="caps">CLI</span> and that can be done with Node and NPM. But instead of running Cordova to add plugins, one has to run Plugman to install&nbsp;plugins.</p>
<p>The flow&nbsp;is </p>
<ul>
<li>download Cordova Native development&nbsp;package</li>
<li>download Node and&nbsp;<span class="caps">NPM</span></li>
<li>install Cordova and Plugman through&nbsp;<span class="caps">NPM</span></li>
<li>create project from inside the dowloaded Cordova&nbsp;folder</li>
<li>navigate to the project&nbsp;folder</li>
<li>run the Plugman command to add plugins to the&nbsp;project</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding.</p>

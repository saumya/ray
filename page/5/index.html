            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/35/">NodeJS, HTML5, JQuery and what you may come across in an interview</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is not a surprise for me, but if you are new to the modern web development and working on Javascript stack, chances are that you come acrcoss these in everyday life. It may come from anywhere, your collegue, your senior, may be from an interviewer. But the cool thing is, you are right in those cases. All you have to do is ignore them and move on. I had seen this while working on Flash platform, when people were saying things about Flash and Flex. Now the platforms are changed but situation are&nbsp;same.          </p>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS is a different&nbsp;language.</li>
<li>NodeJS is not&nbsp;javascript.</li>
<li>NodeJS is bad for not having X, which Y language&nbsp;has</li>
<li>Jquery is a different&nbsp;language.</li>
<li>JQuery is not&nbsp;javascript.</li>
<li>JQuery is better than&nbsp;javascript.</li>
<li><span class="caps">HTML5</span> is a programming&nbsp;language.</li>
<li><span class="caps">HTML5</span> is different from&nbsp;HTML.</li>
<li>Have you worked on <span class="caps">HTML5</span>? If yes, have you worked on&nbsp;DOM?</li>
</ul>
<p>While I could answer to all these in single lines but then the interpretation would be wrong.<br>The point is people coming from traditional languages like, Java and C# and still working on those, think they know all. I would suggest, please come out from that and even if you want to target <span class="caps">JVM</span>, use a modern language like SCALA instead. Well, if these guys try to code in a modern platform like NodeJS, they suddenly make the simple solution, to a complex process, as per the old knowledge they were having. Even the elegance of these new modern platforms like Ruby, NodeJS etc seem to be bad in their eyes. Well, the problem is these guys are sitting on top positions in traditional service based companies. So, if you join one of these companies, or even appear for interview in those companies, chances are you will come across these scenarios. The best part is, you are right and they are wrong. So no need to feel bad if they talk like that. Just ignore and move on but never leave learning.<br>Another big problem for working in frontend is, these conventional people think, they can do a better architecture in frontend too, just because they can use an <span class="caps">ORM</span> in backend. So all those frontend elegant solutions provided by modern stacks will be bent according to these guys to a point where the elegance becomes a pain for you as a frontend developer. They will talk that “we had done these before this way”. Common, that way is over, that time is gone. Now learn something from the modern stack developers and make an elegant backend. I have even seen, these backend guys mentoring ObjectiveC guys, how to do an iPhone Application architecture, without knowing the iOS environment. This is not specific to iOS, but any mobile platform in general. Web is not mobile and there are different considerations and architecture depending upon the platform. While the modern web stack has changed and you simply do not understand it, how you can mentor a mobile application developer! Talking of backends, these guys even think traditional databases are the best, no need to try any other. They even hesitate to try a NoSQL! Common! Thats backend, at least update yourelf there before coming to frontend. Ask any new modern stack web developer, they will blow your mind with the stuff like NoSQL to responsive web applications. Even the enterprise is shifting to modern stack, but these are people who hold on to the past.The end result is, everyone suffers. But again, if you are new to the scenario, then do not worry, they will learn from their mistakes and all these time you have to live with it. All these, for someone on top does not know how to deal with new technology.<br>My honest suggestion to all you people starting your career in web development is, learn from the web, there are plenty of brilliant tutorials and examples available online and move on. Better, if you can, shift to a company where they know, what they are doing, rather than what they used to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/34/">Understanding BackboneJS View Event, jQuery Event and trigger()</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The fun in working with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> is freedom. The library is so decoupled that, one can really do any kind of architecture for an application. This freedom will come in your way if you do not know what is happening behind. We will be focusing on ‘Event’ here.<br>Working with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> often involves working with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> too as a <span class="caps">DOM</span> manupilation library. When we work on HTML and DOM, in terms of <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> we are working on View. At this point we must understand, that this BackboneView can dispatch event and the <span class="caps">DOM</span> we are dealing with also is capable of dispatching event. The point to note here is event dispatched through <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> framework, does not bubble. Where as the default <span class="caps">DOM</span> events bubble. Well, since we generally work with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for <span class="caps">DOM</span> manupilation, events fired through <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> also has the same effect as <span class="caps">DOM</span> events, they bubble. Working with a <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> ViewObject, we deal with <code>el</code> of the ViewObject. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> also provides a <code>$el</code> on each view. Take a note of this <code>$el</code>, which is a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> object.<br>Dispatching an Event in <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> is done&nbsp;as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="comment">//somewhere inside the View</span>
<span class="keyword">this</span>.trigger(<span class="string">'myEvent'</span>,{<span class="string">'data'</span>:<span class="string">'myValue'</span>});
</code></pre>
<p>The basic syntax for <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events-trigger">dispatching an event in BackboneJS</a>&nbsp;is</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">object.trigger(event, [*args])
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that the <code>second parameter</code> in the <code>trigger</code> is <code>data</code> to be passed to the event-handler. Registering the listener for the event will be&nbsp;as </p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">this</span>.listenTo(<span class="keyword">this</span>.viewObject, <span class="string">'myEvent'</span>, <span class="keyword">this</span>.onMyEvent);
</code></pre>
<p>Now writing a handler for this event will look&nbsp;as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="comment">//handler</span>
onMyEvent: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(eventdata)</span>{</span>
    console.log(eventdata);<span class="comment">//example: getting data from the event</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, we get the whole <code>data</code> ( passed to the <code>trigger()</code> method as second parameter ) , as the arguement to the&nbsp;handler. </p>
<p>Now lets focus on the <span class="caps">DOM</span> event for the same scenario.
The dispatcher code will look&nbsp;as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">this</span>.$el.trigger(<span class="string">'myEvent'</span>,{<span class="string">'data'</span>:<span class="string">'myValue'</span>});
</code></pre>
<p>Here, actually it seems that we are using <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> Event, but since we are dealing with <code>$el</code>, we are actually <a href="http://api.jquery.com/trigger/">triggering a <span class="caps">DOM</span> event through jQuery</a>. Since this is a <span class="caps">DOM</span> event, it has all the three phases in its life cycle; capture, target and bubble. So, we can really catch this event on a parent view of <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> and the code would be&nbsp;like </p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">events: {
    <span class="string">'myEvent'</span>: <span class="string">'onMyEvent'</span> <span class="comment">//this is actually listening to <span class="caps">DOM</span> event</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>The handler code will look&nbsp;as </p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">onMyEvent : <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(event,data)</span>{</span>
    event.preventDefault();
    <span class="comment">//code as required by application</span>
    <span class="comment">//But, see the second arguement is actually 'data', passed to 'trigger()'</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">false</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note the difference in event handler here. We have now two arguements and the second arguement is the <code>data</code> that is passed in to <code>trigger()</code> call above.
All that is to it is, how you <code>trigger</code> the event, from the two ways&nbsp;below.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the [BackboneJS]&nbsp;View</li>
<li>From the <span class="caps">DOM</span>&nbsp;element     </li>
</ol>
<p>And then, writing a proper event-handler for the respective&nbsp;Event.     </p>
<p>In <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a>, sometimes you need to deal with situations, where you just want to listen for events without knowing the other Views. That way de-coupling the application. There is Mediator design pattern to do a central event dispatching system for the whole <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> application. Then there is this little but powerful thing, called bubbling, already available to native&nbsp;<span class="caps">DOM</span>.      </p>
<p>Here are the links to the two trigger&nbsp;methods;</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://api.jquery.com/trigger/">jQuery&nbsp;trigger</a></li>
<li><a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events-trigger">BackboneJS&nbsp;trigger</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Bubbling.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/33/">jQuery and fixing AJAX cache for GET calls</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It will come to you very soon, if you are trying to develop any decent webapp or phonegap mobile app using <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.<br>The problem is, if we have the same <code>GET</code> request multiple times, by default jQuery will cache the request. The end result is the response same as the first response!! Well, there is a setting in jQuery <span class="caps">AJAX</span> setup, where in we write <code>cache:false</code> and that should work. Well, depending upon how the <span class="caps">API</span> is written on the server side, this call might not work! There are many reasons as to why it may not work, one simple reason is, to understand, how <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> behaves, when we set <code>cache:false</code> as&nbsp;below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> apiURL = <span class="string">"my/api/server/<span class="caps">URI</span>"</span>;
$.ajax({
    url:apiURL,
    cache: <span class="literal">false</span>,
    success:<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(result)</span>{</span>
        <span class="comment">//</span>
    },
    error:<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(data)</span>{</span>           
        <span class="comment">//            </span>
    }   
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> will append <code>_={timestamp}</code> to the <span class="caps">GET</span> parameters. Here is the <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/">official documentation</a> of the same. The service call will fail, if this extra parameter is not handled properly. A little workarround, fixed this for me, which is appending the timestamp mannually by hand instead of setting <code>cache: false</code> in <span class="caps">AJAX</span> setup of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. The modified code looks as&nbsp;this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> timeStamp = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="built_in">Date</span>().getTime();
<span class="keyword">var</span> apiURL = <span class="string">"my/api/server/<span class="caps">URI</span>/"</span>+timeStamp;
$.ajax({
    url:apiURL,
    <span class="comment">//cache: false,//not needed now</span>
    success:<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(result)</span>{</span>
        <span class="comment">//</span>
    },
    error:<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(data)</span>{</span>           
        <span class="comment">//            </span>
    }   
});
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that worked for me as my <span class="caps">API</span> end point was not handling ‘_’(underscore) properly, but could handle the extra parameters.<br>Depending upon the situations, find a right place and <code>add timestamp mannually</code>, to fix the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> cache instead of setting it in the&nbsp;setup.     </p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding.</p>

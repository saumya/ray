            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/57/">React</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is a library from the famous social networking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a>.          </p>
<p>Another Javascript Library ! Yes, lets face it. Now we can not escape the fact that every other day there is someone, somwhere making a new Javascript<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>library.           </p>
<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is not a competition with the huge frameworks like <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> or <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a>. It neither is competing with the <span class="caps">DOM</span> manipulation libraries like <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>. But for some reason for me, it seems like, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is making a standard for itself. Like <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> did it for <span class="caps">DOM</span> manipulation, becoming a go to library, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is making a place for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>itself.          </p>
<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is a library to <code>write components</code> for <span class="caps">DOM</span>.         </p>
<p>Well, so what does it do ?! It allows us to write reusable <code>component</code> to be used in our <span class="caps">HTML</span>. With <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, its possible to combine one or more <span class="caps">HTML</span> tag/tags and add some javascript to add functionality. Then we can take that component as a whole and reuse it as many times as we want. Thats all that is to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.           </p>
<p>There is <code>JSX</code> in <code>React</code>. <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html"><span class="caps">JSX</span></a> in simple words, would be writing Javascript as if we are writing <span class="caps">HTML</span>. Well, that might not be the case if you already know what <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html"><span class="caps">JSX</span></a> is, but for a first timer its easier to understand like that. The <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">official document</a> is very good resource to understand <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html"><span class="caps">JSX</span></a>. You are not bound to use it but then, it obviously is an<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>option.          </p>
<p>So, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is <code>not a</code> <span class="caps">MVC</span> or <span class="caps">MVVM</span> or <span class="caps">MV</span>* framework ? No, its not. But it just is a library to write reusable <span class="caps">HTML</span> visual compoents. Take this library wherever you want and use it. That means, we can use this library in other frameworks, if we want to. This is like taking <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and adding it to the places we like to use<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.          </p>
<p>Happy React -<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ing.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/56/">AngularJS, BackboneJS, similarities and differences.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>When learning a new framework or library, its very difficult to look at the same problem from a different perspective. But when you hear a lot like ‘ohh, that library is similar to this’, then the tendency comes to compare it. And when you see similar terminology in both the frameworks, then you are absolutely sure that both are doing the same thing in the same way. I think, thats the main problem here with learning the frameworks like <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a>. Both of these have their own share of <code>how to</code> and <code>where to</code>, overall they seem completely different, even though the terminolgies seem completely<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>same.         </p>
<p>One such thing is <code>Module</code>. Both these frameworks define <code>Module</code> and use it. Both of them tell to use <code>Module</code> to separate concerns. But then both of them seem completely different while implementing the <code>Module</code>. Umm, Why?!          </p>
<p>The <code>difference</code> is in the <code>Module</code> definition of both the frameworks. And that pushes back someone very new to the frameworks, thinking something wrong either in the frameworks or in the understanding of them. While the truth is something simpler than<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>that.            </p>
<p><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> uses <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#commonjs">CommonJS</a> module declaration.<br><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> uses <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd"><span class="caps">AMD</span></a> module<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>declaration.          </p>
<p>Once you know this difference, things get a lot easier to understand and will take lesser time than before to get upto speed in either of these. Have a look at the <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#definition">Module Definition</a> documentation, it explains the difference of the module definitions. The bottom line is Javascript eco-system gives us <code>two</code> different kind of <code>Module</code> systems. Frameworks use one over the other depending upon their opinion. For example <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> uses <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#commonjs">CommonJS</a> approach, while <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> toolkit</a> uses <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd"><span class="caps">AMD</span></a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>way.          </p>
<p>Now lets understand why this difference matters us as a developer. In <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#commonjs">CommonJS</a> style declaration, each file is supposed to be a module which is same as <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd"><span class="caps">AMD</span></a> way too. The <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#commonjs">CommonJS</a> module can expose as many Objects as one wants, to the application level. So that once one <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#commonjs">CommonJS</a> module is included, the application has access to all the exposed Objects in that module. For that matter you can understand, why just adding a <code>some-ng-file.js</code> and including that <code>ModuleName</code> in the dependency of an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> application, gives a lot of <code>ngObject</code> to play with. Where in <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd"><span class="caps">AMD</span></a> each module is exposing just one Object. If you want to play with the internals of that Object, you have to call that Object’s properties and methods. This way makes you feel like as if you are working in a Classical (Class based) language rather than Prototypical language. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> is doing exactly the same thing. Once you have got a <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> module Object, you deal with it as if you are dealing with an Object from a Class. You invoke methods and properties of that<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Object.           </p>
<p>So one <code>Module</code> in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is exposing a lot to play with and one <code>Module</code> in <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> gives you just one Object to play with. The similarity goes to other frameworks and libraries as I mentioned earlier about <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a>.</p>
<p>Happy coding with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>modules.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/55/">AngularJS 102</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is the part two of the study of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. The first part is <a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/39/">AngularJS 101</a>.
This is focused on the vary basic concepts of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> like how and where to write a <code>controller</code> or <code>directive</code> etc. The <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-102">sample project is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here</a>.          </p>
<p>First thing first, as of any Javascript framework, the nature of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is not different in terms of, where you should write what. This is understood, as Javascript itself is dynamic in nature. There are a lot of guidelines through out the web as to, which file to contain what. In the end it boils down to personal preference. So just go ahead and do some working samples of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>yours.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you need is <code>index.html</code> or some <code>.html</code> file, which will be your entry point to the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>project.</li>
<li>Include all the Javascript files in this <code>index.html</code> file as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>needed</li>
<li><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> does not need <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, but if you are using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, you will need <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> library as the later uses it. So include them in the <code>index.html</code></li>
<li>Include the <span class="caps">CSS</span> framework files in the <code>index.html</code></li>
<li>All in all, include all the files necessary in the project in <code>index.html</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there are ways to minify and combine all of them in a single file and all those tricks. We can focus on them later. For the timebeing lets focus on how to build <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the end include your <code>application.js</code> file, which will be your application entry file. Name of the file is not relevant, you can name it<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the application could be written in a single Javascript file or the application could be divided to be written in different Javascript files, each having a particular scope of work. Whatever the case may be, just remember each Javascript file should be an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> appModule = angular.module(<span class="string">'app.Main'</span>,[<span class="string">"ngRoute"</span>,<span class="string">"ngResource"</span>]);
})();</code></pre>
<p>The general convention is to wrap each module inside an immediately invoking function, just not to pollute the global space of the Javascript. As in the example above, we are using <code>ngRoute</code> and <code>ngResource</code> in our module <code>app.Main</code>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each Javascript file should be an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Module</li>
<li>Each module can use another module as a dependency and that can be passed in as a parameter in the array as shown<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>above</li>
<li>By now, you must have noticed, the name of the Javascript file and the name of the module might be different. As long as we provide proper name as dependecy and proper name for the script src, it is all<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>good.          </li>
</ul>
<p>Actually in the example above, the dependent modules <code>ngRoute</code> and <code>ngResource</code> is not present in the <code>angular.js</code> Javascript file . These modules are written in separate Javascript files as modules. So we need to include <code>angular-route.js</code> and <code>angular-resource.js</code> in our <code>.html</code> file to use them, else it will through<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>error.       </p>
<pre><code class="language-html"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"js/lib/angular-1.4.7/angular.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"js/lib/angular-1.4.7/angular-route.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"js/lib/angular-1.4.7/angular-resource.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-102">Sample Project</a>.   
Lets define another module in a javascript file named <code>one.js</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
  <span class="keyword">var</span> mOne = angular.module(<span class="string">'module.one'</span>,[]);
})();</code></pre>
<p>Now lets expose a factory from this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
  <span class="keyword">var</span> mOne = angular.module(<span class="string">'module.one'</span>,[]);
  mOne.factory(<span class="string">'oneFactory'</span>,<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{
    <span class="keyword">var</span> service = {};
    <span class="keyword">return</span> service;
  });
})();</code></pre>
<p>To use this factory in our project. We have<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>to </p>
<ul>
<li>include the <code>one.js</code> in our html<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>file</li>
<li>add the module name <code>module.one</code> in our application entry<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>file          </li>
</ul>
<p>So the application entry file will look as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>{<span class="string">'use strict'</span>;
  <span class="keyword">var</span> appModule = angular.module(<span class="string">'app.Main'</span>,[<span class="string">"ngRoute"</span>,<span class="string">"ngResource"</span>,<span class="string">"module.one"</span>]);
  <span class="comment">// Now, we can use 'oneFactory' here, as its exposed by 'module.one'</span>
})();</code></pre>
<p>Each Javascript file should be an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>module.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each module could expose any number of anything. That means, any module could expose more than one Object. Those Objects could be any <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngluarJS</a> Object types, such as Controller, Factory, Service, Directive<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>etc.</li>
<li>As long as we are providing a dependency of the module name in the Array and refering the proper name of the Objects, we can use<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>them.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Directives</code> in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> are <code>visual elements</code>. They define custom <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags/elements as per their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>definition.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-102">Sample Project</a> and that should clear a lot of things, which might seem unclear here. <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is modular in the sense, there are carefully separated modules for different purposes. When in need, we include those Javascript files and add the dependecies in the Array. The same goes for our own modules. Try to separate out functionalities into their own modules and use it when<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>needed.   </p>
<p>Hopefully that will get you started with the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>framework.</p>

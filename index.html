            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/54/">A year with DOJO Toolkit.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>There are a number of reasons to use a specific framework in a work environment. But sometimes it boils down to just the hype. For example in recent past almost all the companies are trying to implement <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and before that time it was the time for <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> and the story goes on like that. It is always a good experience to work in very different kind of framework or for that matter its even better to work in different kind of languages&nbsp;altogether.          </p>
<p>The last year was <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> Toolkit</a> year for me. I must say I am impressed to see features it provides and now that its moving in the right direction. For a long time now, this toolkit was just stagnant but last year only they have started moving again. Well, if you come from a <code>pure Javascript</code> background might not like it by the way it is designed and behaves. The <span class="caps">UI</span> layer of the <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> Toolkit</a> named as Dijit will seem like Flex components (If you know what Flash and Flex is, you will get what I am saying). The framework itself is designed to make people comfortable, who are used to Classical programming languages like <span class="caps">JAVA</span>. The whole toolkit will show itself, as a class based toolkit. The average user will just think and use it as a Classical programming language, which is the root of all evil things in a project. Thats part of the team and how it works with this&nbsp;toolkit.          </p>
<p>In general if we talk about the features this toolkit gives us, I would say its nice and efficient if we use it the way it is meant to. The next version is already on progress and they are moving to <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, that a nice move. All in all its a nice experience working with this&nbsp;framework.     </p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>First of all there are 2 modes. <code>Insert</code> and <code>Command</code> . By default one is in the command&nbsp;mode.</p>
<pre><code>i : to move to insert mode
esc : to move out from insert mode
</code></pre><p>Following is a set of commands I use in a regular&nbsp;basis.</p>
<pre><code>a : append : start after cursor
i : insert : start before cursor

w : move forward word by word
b : move backwars word by word

ctrl+F : scroll forward 1 screen
ctrl+B : scroll backward 1 screen
ctrl+D : scroll forward 1/2 screen
ctrl+U : scroll backward 1/2 screen

ctrl+E : scroll forward 1 line
ctrl+Y : scroll backward 1 line

ctrl+H : move to top line
ctrl+M : move to middle line
ctrl+L : move to last line

/ : search for pattern : forward from cursor
? : search for pattern : backwards from cursor

f,F : search inline forward,backward
t,T : move cursor to occurance of the character forwar,backward
; , , : repear last find command forward and backward

ctrl+G : print line info
G : move the cursor by line number
</code></pre><p><code>ctrl+L</code> : Redraw the screen : <code>Remember the screen in just a buffer of texts</code><br>Configuring vi&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>set nu : show line numbers
set nowrapscan : search does not wrap TOP or BOTTOM
</code></pre><p>Happy&nbsp;editing.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/52/">Git, Forking and Syncing</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>There are couple of things to understand before going to the commandline, just remember that we have assumed the name <code>UPSTREAM</code> as the repository, from where we have forked the project and <code>master</code> is our own remote repository where we save our changes.
Well, another important thing is to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/">configure</a> the <code>UPSTREAM</code> or simply configure a repository from where we want to&nbsp;sync.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-git">git remote -v
git remote add UPSTREAM https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
</code></pre>
<p>For syncing forked repository, the commands are as&nbsp;below.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-git">git remote -v
git fetch UPSTREAM
git checkout master
git merge UPSTREAM/master
git push origin master
</code></pre>
<p>This is a direct <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">tutorial from github</a>.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;syncing.</p>

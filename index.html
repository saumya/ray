          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>If you are developing for native Android, and creating a Facebook login, then the fist thing which will come to you, is a setting on Facebook console called “Key Hashes”. While trying to do the Facebook suggested way, I lost some time and could not really get it working perfectly. Searching the internet told me that people had been in that path and that the solution is not working.<br>Well, then I got a script to get the hash key. Finally this worked for me, all the time. So quickly I wrapped it in a function and put it here for anyone trying to fight the “key&nbsp;hash”.    </p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/saumya/8399013.js"></script>    

<p>Now, all that remains is, put this function on the first activity of your Android project and call the function with your package name as a string arguement on the onCreation method. That will print out the hash key on logCat window. Just copy-paste that code in Facebook console. Then you can remove that call to the&nbsp;function.    </p>
<p>Happy Hacking&nbsp;! </p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/7/">Wintersmith configuration</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a> is perfect on creating a static site, but the problem arises when one needs to configure it to meet a particular need. I think, thats true for any framework.<br>The problem I encountered is, putting the static blog in any domain or sub-domain. <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a> generates urls which are default to root <code>/</code> and to change it to any domain means one has to change it to the domain one wishes to put the site on. Thats as simple as that. Well, for most parts. Then, there are places where it creates a relative&nbsp;<span class="caps">URL</span>.    </p>
<p>To solve this, I looked inside the templates and configuration. <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a> reads from the <code>config.json</code> file to get the base <span class="caps">URL</span> and make the other URLs. So I changed the <code>url</code> to my desired <span class="caps">URL</span> and added another parameter to the <code>locals</code> object of the <code>config.json</code> named <code>folder</code>, Then changed the <span class="caps">URL</span> in templates, from <code>/</code> to <code>locals.url</code> and at some places to <code>locals.url+&#39;/&#39;+locals.folder</code> and thats it. Its now perfectly alright to take my site to wherever I want. All I need to do is change these variables and build the site again with <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a> build command.<br>Is this the rightway? Well, seriously I do not know, but it&nbsp;works.   </p>
<p>Happy Hacking&nbsp;! </p>

          <section class="content"><p>The final technical integration to <code>make the blog a conversation</code> engine, is done. Can not imagine how far the blogging has come and how easy now it is to setup things. Yes can feel the new internet now. Remembering the back days, when I created a static <span class="caps">HTML</span> page and served through internet. Its a full circle now. Though the generation of the static pages are automated, but the thing is we are back to decentralised&nbsp;internet.</p>

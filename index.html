            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/95/">Setting up Thunk with Redux and React</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is one of the reasons why getting up and running with <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> may take sometime. The setting up of the whole thing takes time. And it may take more time, if you want to setup this after you have a working <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> project. To start a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> project today, it is easy to get up and running with <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create-React-App</a>. But gluing up <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> after that point is a very difficult and confusing process. And then comes <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk">Thunk</a> which will take some more involvement into<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Working with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> is just sweet. 
The most important thing for me is less noise in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>web.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the community is active, very active, no one is making a loud noise throughout the internet. I think that is because, no one is trying to please the corporates they are working for and they are targetting to. Which is a very good sign as far as the framework<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appart from that, the documentation is just spot on. There is no way anyone will get to a wrong place and search for answers somewhere<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>else. </p>
<p>The eco-system for the framework is also just spot on and their documentation is as sweet. It all just<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>works.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/93/">Database and doing things without the 'for' Loop</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is valid for all the languages and database engines.
The thing is to create / read / update / delete somethings in database. So it is about multiple actions in a table inserts / reads / updates / deletes. The quick and easy solution is to put the actions in a ‘for loop’ and then try to solve the problems created by the loop itself! There are better<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ways. </p>

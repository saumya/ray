<p>Sometimes, no, all the time, if the experience is real, there are no words to express<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being an entrepreneur is same as being in life. Nothing is fixed. It changes every moment. And that is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>beautiful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Journey is important and it is the only<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>thing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no destination as such. Somehow we plan for somthing and move on with it. Whether it is achieved or not, does not matter. By the time we reach there, the whole plan is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is a major turn in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>journey. </p>

<p>Happy Life.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/106/">Distributed Web is here. ClientServer to ClientClient. IPFS.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It is here and happening now. I was predicting it will take some more time, but it is here<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>now.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ipfs.io"><span class="caps">IPFS</span></a> is making its presence<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>felt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web a faster, safer, and more<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the major browsers, <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a> has <a href="https://brave.com/brave-integrates-ipfs/">implemented <span class="caps">IPFS</span></a> into<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.</p>
<p>That actually means the way the softwares are developed today, is going to change. Whether you like it or not. It is going to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Server-Client to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Client-Client</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is going to be exciting to see the distributed web flourish. The marketing and the buzz about the <code>scaling the product</code> is going to be obsolete. Why?! Because the applications are going to be decentralized. No central server and scaling required. Each visitor(client) is a host(a server) in itself. So the <code>scaling</code> is in-built. More the visitors, better the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>experiences.</p>
<p>Seems 2021 is beginning a new era in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>itself.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>

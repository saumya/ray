            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/39/">AngularJS 101</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It took me sometime to make me comfortable in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. There are a lot of tutorials, discussions and videos out there about <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. I would suggest, go through them and go through as many as you can, before jumping into code with this framework. We will be looking at the very basics of the framework here and for <code>version 1.3</code> and above, of the framework.<br>You must heard about <span class="caps">MVC</span> or Model-View-Controller architecture and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. While thats true, lets keep that for a little late.<br>First of all, just remember that <code>$scope</code> is model object and sometimes referred to as <code>ViewModel</code>. Then there are <code>Views</code>, which are either <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags or full html files. And then <code>Controllers</code>, which are javascript files. At this point always remember that <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> revolves arround these <code>View</code> and <code>Controller</code>. The data this <code>View</code> displays is the same as the data the <code>Controller</code> modifies and is available through <code>$scope</code>. No matter what, <code>$scope</code> remains in the middle as this<br><code>View &lt;---$scope---&gt; Controller</code><br>Now, since <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> already uses <code>2-way data binding</code> any changes to data or <code>$scope</code> in <code>View</code> or <code>Controller</code> is reflected by each other.<br>An <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> application begins with a module named <code>ng-app</code> and this <code>ng-app</code> is generally only one. So what is a module ? Module is kind of self contained small applications inside a big application. The special module <code>ng-app</code> is the only exception as its the big application and everything else in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> world happens inside it. All other modules generally go inside <code>ng-view</code>, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-101/blob/master/index.html">this html page</a> for the reference.In terms of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, a module is a combination of a <code>View-$scope-Controller</code>. Everytime you need to load this module, the View gets loaded in the <code>ng-view</code> and its Controller gets initialised along with the <code>$scope</code>. All these mapping are written in a <code>Route</code>, which maps <code>View with Controller</code>, <a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-101/blob/master/js/saumyaApp.js">take a look at this</a>. Route is a separate module as of <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> version 1.3. So, one need to include the <span class="caps">JS</span> file and the dependency. A quick reference of an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> application looks as&nbsp;below        </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">HTML</span>&nbsp;page</li>
<li>ng-app (root&nbsp;module)</li>
<li>ng-view (sub modules load&nbsp;here)</li>
<li>first <span class="caps">JS</span> file for Route and other&nbsp;things</li>
<li>Route maps <span class="caps">URL</span> paths with sub-views and their&nbsp;controllers</li>
<li>sub-views(<span class="caps">HTML</span> partials or pages) are loaded inside the ng-view and initialied with their&nbsp;controllers        </li>
</ul>
<p>So far we are good. The next thing is, we can still make it more modularised. <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> allows, something called as <code>Directives</code>, you may think of it as components. Inside a <code>Module</code>, we can write our custom directives, which are <code>custom HTML tags</code> along with its <code>controller</code>. But always remember, <code>Directives</code> are part of <code>View</code>. So the <code>$scope</code> is also available to them. Now, there are different pre-built modules with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> for different job in hand, like <code>$http</code> is for interacting with <code>web services</code>.<br><a href="https://github.com/saumya/ng-101">Refer to the project here</a>, which I have created to better understand the basic of an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> application. Always remember, anything in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> that we write falls upon either <code>View</code> or <code>Controller</code> and there is always <code>$scope</code> available to both of&nbsp;these.        </p>
<p>I would love to listen your inputs on this, please leave a comment for&nbsp;discussion.         </p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;Coding.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/37/">Upgrading to Ruby 2.x from 1.x with rvm, on an upgrade from old OSX to Mavericks.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is a situation when you have updated the <span class="caps">OS</span> from a previous version of Mac OSX to the latest version of the OSX Mavericks. Generally OSX ships with a version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, which is latest by the time the <span class="caps">OS</span> is released. But when it comes to OSX upgrade and in this case particularly to OSX Mavericks, the operating system upgrade does not bring in the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> upgrade. Rather, the old <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> lives on the new <span class="caps">OSX</span>. Well, if you have a decent understanding of managing <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> versions, you may be using one of the version management systems of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. I used to have <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. Now I have an upgraded <span class="caps">OSX</span> but need to have the latest version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. The steps are as&nbsp;below     </p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a></li>
<li>Upgrade <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Well, there are issues with these two steps as I found throughout the net. A simple search in the internet will make you aware of this fact. So the refined steps are as&nbsp;below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install XCode Commandline&nbsp;tools</li>
<li>Reinstall <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a></li>
<li>Upgrade <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In my case, I do not have to install the XCode commandline tools, probably because I am an iOS developer and always updates to the latest version of XCode along with the commandline tools. The thing to note here is with the <span class="caps">OSX</span> upgrade, the commandline tools of XCode is removed by the system. Even if, one installs the new <code>XCode</code>, the <code>commandline tools</code> are not included by default. All one has to do is <code>install</code> it (<code>again</code>).<br>Moving on, the next step is to upgrade the <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. With the <span class="caps">OSX</span> upgrade, the normal <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a> update does not&nbsp;work.</p>
<pre><code>rvm get stable
</code></pre><p>So, the fix is to <code>install rvm</code> (you can call it <code>again</code>) as&nbsp;below.</p>
<pre><code>\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
</code></pre><p>Once this step is done everything else is just normal <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> update thing. Update <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> with the commad as&nbsp;below.</p>
<pre><code>rvm install ruby-2.1.1
</code></pre><p>Now lets install a gem such as json, which can be done with the command as follows. I was suggesting <del>sudo gem install json</del>, but never do that. Instead&nbsp;use</p>
<pre><code>gem install json
</code></pre><p>It seems using <code>sudo</code> <code>is not advisable</code> to be used while using <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. I got a reply in twitter for this blog post, from <a href="https://twitter.com/rvm_io">@rvm_io</a>&nbsp;as </p>
<blockquote>
<p>looks good, the only hint - never use sudo with <span class="caps">RVM</span>, sudo “disables” RVM controlled ruby, the gem most likely is installed in&nbsp;system    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thats all to it. The important thing is, if we try to install the 2.x version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> with old <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, it will not work. Actually, it does not show even in the known list of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;upgrading.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>I was ignoring this for a long time. As <code>Disqus</code> was powering this blog comments, I thought it is alright to ignore. Then came a time, when I found it is true, as to why people are getting away from <code>Disqus</code>. A simple search in the internet will fetch you a lot of information about what/why of this commenting system. So I am not putting out the pointed information about the story<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here.</p>
<p>Finally I am here, removing that comment system from the blog here. Not sure what I am going to use yet. Till that time it is alright to ping me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/saumya">Twitter</a>.</p>

### Version 2.0
 
 This application is updated to use the latest `Wintersmith` and other libraries. Now it can be run from the local install instead from the global `npm` modules.


```
/path/to/local/node_modules/wintersmith/bin/wintersmith preview
```

or with `relative path`

```
./node_modules/wintersmith/bin/wintersmith preview
```



### WIP
 
 Have changed `Wintersmith` library by changing the `package.json` entry from

```
"marked": "^0.5.1",
```

to

```
"marked": ">=0.6.1",
```

[Saumya][1] believes in The God.

A maker of things and curious about everything. Coninuous learning is what fuels him. After completing Bachelor's degree in Architecture and working for some years in the field, he moved on to interactive media. 

This blog itself reflects one of many things he is trying at all the time.

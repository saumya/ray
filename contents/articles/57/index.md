[React][3] is a library from the famous social networking [facebook][4].          

Another Javascript Library ! Yes, lets face it. Now we can not escape the fact that every other day there is someone, somwhere making a new Javascript library.           

[React][3] is not a competition with the huge frameworks like [AngularJS][1] or [BackboneJS][2]. It neither is competing with the DOM manipulation libraries like [jQuery][5]. But for some reason for me, it seems like, [React][3] is making a standard for itself. Like [jQuery][5] did it for DOM manipulation, becoming a go to library, [React][3] is making a place for itself.          

[React][3] is a library to `write components` for DOM.         

Well, so what does it do ?! It allows us to write reusable `component` to be used in our HTML. With [React][3], its possible to combine one or more HTML tag/tags and add some javascript to add functionality. Then we can take that component as a whole and reuse it as many times as we want. Thats all that is to it.           

There is `JSX` in `React`. [JSX][6] in simple words, would be writing Javascript as if we are writing HTML. Well, that might not be the case if you already know what [JSX][6] is, but for a first timer its easier to understand like that. The [official document][6] is very good resource to understand [JSX][6]. You are not bound to use it but then, it obviously is an option.          

So, [React][3] is `not a` MVC or MVVM or MV* framework ? No, its not. But it just is a library to write reusable HTML visual compoents. Take this library wherever you want and use it. That means, we can use this library in other frameworks, if we want to. This is like taking [jQuery][5] and adding it to the places we like to use it.          



Happy React - ing.

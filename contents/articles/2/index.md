`Why?` Thats for being there as a very solid option for blogging.

<span class="more">

Its a pleasure to use [Wordpress][1] for such along time. In fact its the reason I started into blogging. I have a [Wordpress][2] hosted blog till now too. 
This blog was using Wordpress as its blogging engine from 2010 and thats a beautiful engine, I must say.

The reason I moved this to [Wintersmith][3] is, I want to focus on javascript environment now, the same reason was there, with Wordpress. 
I was focusing on PHP and MySql, those days. So its not that Wordpress is bad but seriously speaking Wordpress is now far beyound a blogging platform.

###### December of 2017 ended with my first ever visit to Court at Cuttack, Odisha. 

The visits to the Court continue through out 2018. ~~That's another story.~~

Professionally the year 2018, was not much to offer but personally it was loaded with experiencces.

2018 started at Keonjhar in Odisha, as the last night of 2017 was a road trip.

Got involved in some architectural projects by the help of some of my friends. Architectural design and visualisations are part of the experience of 2018. In the early parts of 2018, I had to visit Mumbai to represent an Architectural consultancy.

Visakhapatnam, for the first time! A friend, whom I met after more than 15 years, became a fantastic host. We did travel around mountains, beaches and the city walk and rides with a little kid, just amazing.

Coimbatore, for the first time! This place is nice and hot :) Stayed as a paying guest to a nice host. It never felt I am out of my home. My first ever **bike ride** in the **Nilgiri Moutains**! This one is a must if you happen to be on that side of the country. Sun, heavy rain and chilly cold along with the curvy roads of the steep mountains and tea gardens are just too good to drive through. A half day drive one way, felt as if its just getting started. 

Ooty, for the first time! A small and beautiful place.

Isha Yoga Center, for the first time! Spent some time each day at [Dhyanalinga][dl] Yogic Temple and the Yoga Center complex. First time, accidentally saw Sadhguru in person and listened to his discourse in person at the Yoga Center.

Travelled back to Bengaluru in a train, which was 8 hours late! However made some friends at the Coimbatore station and the journey was just an amazing experience. It was a general ticket journey and more than half a distance I was standing on the train at night. That opened my eyes towards the cooperation people have. People were offering their sheets to others, willingly! 

Mysuru, for the first time. The early morning train from Bengaluru to Mysuru is a must have, if you want to get the maximum experience of the places. Another friend, met after 20 years, became my host! A couple of days and Mysuru is just a nice experience. A teen at home means, home is always energetic. And a willingness to life is all one needs to experience the good that life has to offer. Car ride to the **Chamundi Hills** and visiting the temple was part of the hospitality that I got. A ride arround the city and we ended that day arround Mysuru palace. Next day I trekked the Chamundi Hill on my own and that was also a beautiful experience. There is a Bull temple on the way to top of the hill.

Bangalore stay made more meaningful as I met couple of friends after a long time. 

Moved to Mumbai to meet another friend, whom I met after 20 years! It never felt that we never met for 20 long years! Life is amazing.

For the first time, travelled to **Sambalpur** and **Paradip** in Odisha, on two different trips! I was wondering we could have spent some more time there. Never mind, may be some other day!

Made a road trip to **Rourkela**, Odisha with a friend. Must say, the roads are amazing to drive and the route is scenic. I was for the first time in that city!

I got myself formally initiated into Yoga on November 2018.

Met with a school friend after 25 years in my home town! And some more old friends in the City.

Another road trip to the jungles of the Banapur, Odisha. It was an one day travel to deep inside the jungle.

### All most all the travels that I did in 2018 was absolutely not planned. They just went so well that thinking of never planning a travel.

And to end the year, I was in the stadium to see semi finals of Mens' Hockey Worldcup. What an experience!  

The 2018 was kind of staying at home and visiting the Court at regular basis. However, I am glad that I could gather up so much memories despite of the Court and its typical activities. Dealing with the Lawyers was one of a kind job. That is also a new experience in 2018.

Overall it was kind of rebooting the life, a lot of first time things! Meeting the age old friends and very new experiences.

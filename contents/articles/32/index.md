Its almost 2 months, I did a project on [Lime][3]([OpneFL][2]). Fortunately this weekend is the time and I started it. Well, first thing to mention is, there is a huge update to the whole tooling and many libraries of the [HAXE][1], Lime and OpenFL land. Allmost all the libs are updated.     
Upon the develoment land on `mac`, the first thing I noticed is, there is no need to type
```
haxelib run openfl test neko
haxelib run lime test neko
```
This is just as simple as calling directly as below.
```
lime test neko
```
Yeah. Thats good start. I thought to document it here, as I have used to the commands on `mac` and suddenly its changed (though changed for good), a note would be a point of reference in the future to refer to.

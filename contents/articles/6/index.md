First question to answer is `why I moved to a static page solution?`, there are a lot of answers to this.
Here is a nice writeup by David Tucker. [The Need for a Static Site Generator.][1]     
Now, since we know a static page site is the need of the time, the technology choice is important too. Obviously the first thing, that comes to mind is [Jekyll][2], yeah, its simple and just works. Being in MAC, its even tempting to use [Jekyll][2], as [Ruby][3] comes installed with the OS. Further more [Jekyll][2] support is in-built with [GitHub Pages][4]. It could have been as simple as that.   
I choose Javascript as the language of choice, since its exciting now, what we could do with it, so this blog would be one of my playgrounds for the work I do. I have already getting more and more familiar with [Jade][5] templating engine and [nodeJS][6] workflows, [wintersmith][7] is such a nice engine which works on [nodeJS][6]. Just the matter of time, as how far Javascript has come!   

Happy Coding

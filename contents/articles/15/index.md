It is exciting to work with juniours and if you have never had an experience, try this. Which is highly recommended.     
They can bring one or all of below.
- Bring fresh ideas to the table.
- Bring in energy
- New ways of doing things
- Challenge the established
- Go the extra mile to prove it
- Can surprise you by solving something which you never have thought
- Bring in humanity
- Less logical and more intuitional
- Eager to learn     

Well, I can go on and on. But the thing is, you have to be careful. Like all seniors are not helpful, not all young ones have the qualities.      
If you are a good mentor, then `make them conversant with the tools` and `do not` tell them, `how to do`, at first. Ask them `what to do ?`, you will be surprised by the results, they produce.     

Happy Pair-Programming.

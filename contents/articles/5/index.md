The final technical integration to `make the blog a conversation` engine, is done. Can not imagine how far the blogging has come and how easy now it is to setup things. Yes can feel the new internet now. Remembering the back days, when I created a static HTML page and served through internet. Its a full circle now. Though the generation of the static pages are automated, but the thing is we are back to decentralised internet.

Cheers.

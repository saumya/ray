This is the `first time`, I worked with [Parse][1] and must say its a nice to have tool for any web developer. [Parse][1] minimises the task a lot in terms of backend and hosting.     
[Parse][1] has a lot of options to choose from and one can choose to use the only required ones.     
Well, I started of with hosting only, for one of my [Facebook][2] applications. They even have a SDK to integrate the [Facebook][2] SDK with them. I have not yet implemented their SDK yet, but docs show its simplicity of use.     
I have started working on a [BackboneJS][3] application integrating [Facebook][2] and hosting in [Parse][1]. That went quite smooth. Actually [Parse][1] `has extended` [BackboneJS][3] to provide another SDK of their own to create frontend applications.     
Happy coding.

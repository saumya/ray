My mother is no more. I do not know whether she had seen in her life anytime that my father and I share the same day as birthday.
 
 - Today is `Vasanta Panchami`, Saraswati Puja.
 - Today is my father's birthday.
 - Today is my birthday.

Since my birth I have never seen these three in one day.

 - Today I joined `Isha Foundation` as a developer.
 - Today from being an entreprenuer back to an employee.
 - Entreprenuer journey is always like this only. You never know what comes next.

There are a lot of learning as an entreprenuer. I could have never learned all these, sitting in an office. Everyone should try entreprenuership for atleast 5 years at a streach.

Joining `Isha Foundation` may be for a huge turn in my life. I really hope to make some positive contributions to the work the foundation is already involved in.

This `joining the foundation` came to me as a surprise. I never hoped I will join an organisation after doing consulting for almost 5 years.



Namaskaram.

Happy Life.

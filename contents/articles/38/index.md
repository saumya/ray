I had seen [AngularJS][1] before, almost one year back. When I came back to have a look at it again now, I got surprised to see "How long it has really come!". Well here, I am just introducing some of the libraries, frameworks and projects that have eveloved arround [AngularJS][1].          
- [AngularJS][1]
- [Polymer][2]
- [Angular Dart][3]
- [ngCordova][4], Cordova powered by AngularJS.
- [Ionic][5], framework for Hybrid Mobile Apps.


Happy Coding.

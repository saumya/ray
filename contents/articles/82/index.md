PHP frameworks have really taken up some new concepts from other technology such as NodeJS and Ruby. On my search for an easy deployable framework to server, I found both [CakePHP][cake] and [Slim][slim] are good enough.

For getting started with development [CakePHP][cake] seems like old school as one just needs to download the package and put it on a server and get into coding. While [Slim][slim] seems to be a little more learning as one needs to get used to [Composer][3]. [CakePHP][cake] also has an option to get started using [Composer][3].

[CakePHP][cake] is a full framework having everything to get an application running on server. [Slim][slim] seems to be a better option to get upto speed with API development.

As a programmer, there are a lot of good things out there. Probably this is the best time to make a choice. There might just be the language of your choice.<span class="more">

It is a pity that people suffer choices. They always wanted to choose, but in the end they go with the masses and convince themselves that "they want it". However as I see it, the programming languages have really matured. `There is a language of that kind.` No matter if you are a OOP person or a Functional person, in the backend or frontend, there is a language to your choice.

Towards the later part of the last year `2020`, I was thinking of diving into some new programming language. I went through a lot of online documents, videos and code samples. The things that interest me were

 - [Go][go]
 - [Python][py]
 - [Deno][de]

These three seemed to me as a nice team. After learning the basics and done some quick applications with [Go][go]. I am kind of thinking, why I did not found the language earlier! It is small and does the job. With [Python][py] it is similar feeling. A lot could be done with the kind of simplicity and roboustness the langugage provides. On the frontend [Deno][de] is a nice tool to experiement with.

Done some [Kotlin][kt] and [Php][php] for an Android development project. I did a small project to see, how it works. Seems [Php][php] has come a long way. One can write pure Functional programming in [Php][php]. This is just amazing as `how simple` it all has become to achieve the complex of things.

Though there is a lot of noise around [Rust][ru], I do not think it can be handled at the same time. But that does not keep me away from that. Whenever I could, will jump into [Rust][ru] to see how far I could swim in there.





Happy Coding.

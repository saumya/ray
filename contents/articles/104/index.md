It is becoming obvious that we need tools for people. Read that again. Currently the situation is, we make tools for organisations / corporates and may be government. But the root is people and somewhere in this busy train, the importance of `individual people` are lost. Fortunately the world has a lot of passionate people who care about people. Everyday there are better softwares made for the people. 

Here is a software to make people host there own `Instagram` kind of photo sharing application in their own server. This is simple. It requires to upload the folder to the server and done. No server configuration, no database setup.

I call it `Minstagram`.

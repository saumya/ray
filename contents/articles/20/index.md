Continuing to create themes, which are free of the dependencies, here is my next theme, `Elegant`. I am definitenly in love with [Wintesmith][1]. My frequency of blogging has increased exponentially. I am releasing this [theme][2] at github in my [Wintersmith Themes][3] repository. It adds some typography to the plain theme [Simple][4].      

Its a free as in air, theme, and encourage you to take it, hack it and use it, for whatever reason you may want it to use.     

Happy hacking.

This came to me as a surprise that, in today's world for web related work one has to work with `tables` as if its 1999. Well, I am talking about designing and developing for email newsletters. Here is a [tutorial from 2010][1] which still is relevant. So yes, if you have gone through the above tutorial you have already known, for the reference I will mention it again here.

[Code like itâ€™s 1999 (literally)][1] and I agree to it. Below is a list of things to remember while making HTML email newsletters.

### The to-do list

 - HTML and CSS, ~~(well, not HTML5 and CSS3)~~
 - Layouts are all `table` nothing more ~~(no CSS layouts or box models)~~
 - ~~No Canvas, no Webgl, no javascript, no modern web~~
 - CSS should always be inline ~~(no extenal and no CSS declarations)~~   
 - [Images][6] should be named short and `Alt text` should be present
 - It is the best to use a single column layout
 - Use images to layout and display groups of information instead of trying to recreate the same in HTML and CSS
 - Maximum width of layout should be 600px

Here is a [tutorial][2] showing the steps to create an [HTML template][2] from scratch.

In order to get rid of the dependencies and make the site pure static, I re-wrote some of the CSS and font dependencies in the [Wintesmith][1]. I am releasing this [theme][2] at github in my [Wintersmith Themes][3] repository. The name of the theme is `Simple`.      
Its a free as in air theme, and encourage you to take it, hack it and use it, for whatever reason you may want it to use.     
This blog today is using `Simple` theme as an example of, what it looks like to use this theme.

Happy hacking.

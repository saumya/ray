After a week of searching, studying and re-searching things, finally landed up with this.
Well, there is not much to [wintersmith][2], it 10 mins job at max if someone has a little experience in NodeJS.The main delay for me was to trying to produce a static site out of my old blog, which was running in [WordPress][1] eninge.

Cheers.

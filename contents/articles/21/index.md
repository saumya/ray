Like many other things, there are a lot of nice typography available, which are free to use. There is no hidden spying on you or hidden charges or anything hidden, in the name of free.     
I would like to mention, the two types, which are used in the theme [Elegant][2] for [Wintersmith][1].     

[Kaushan Script][3] and [TeX Gyre Adventor][4]

I found these fonts at [fontsquirrel][5].

[Elegant][2] is a free as in air, theme, and encourage you to take it, hack it and use it, for whatever reason you may want it to use.     

Happy hacking.

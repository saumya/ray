I am suprised to see, how big the javascript community has become! And specifically [NodeJS][1] has some serious people in its community. I was trying to do a desktop application in javascript and without searching in the internet, I started out to do it all over again! After a couple of days, out of curiosity, did a search in internet to find, that [NodeJS][1] has plenty of options to do the stuff.     
Evaluating some options, I settled with [Node-Webkit][2]. For now the best 3 in my opinion are;
- [Node-Webkit][2]
- [AppJS][3]
- [hex][4]

I must say, [NodeJS][1] has already revolutionised the internet. If at all, you think of doing something, search for a [NodeJS][1] solution and its possible that the solution is already there.

Happy coding.

It is here and happening now. I was predicting it will take some more time, but it is here now.

The [IPFS][1] is making its presence felt.

> A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web a faster, safer, and more open.

One of the major browsers, [Brave][2] has [implemented IPFS][3] into it.

That actually means the way the softwares are developed today, is going to change. Whether you like it or not. It is going to be.

> From Server-Client to Client-Client

It is going to be exciting to see the distributed web flourish. The marketing and the buzz about the `scaling the product` is going to be obsolete. Why?! Because the applications are going to be decentralized. No central server and scaling required. Each visitor(client) is a host(a server) in itself. So the `scaling` is in-built. More the visitors, better the experiences.

Seems 2021 is beginning a new era in itself.

Happy Coding.

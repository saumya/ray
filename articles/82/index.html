          <section class="content"><p><span class="caps">PHP</span> frameworks have really taken up some new concepts from other technology such as NodeJS and Ruby. On my search for an easy deployable framework to server, I found both <a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> and <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> are good<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>enough.</p>
<p>For getting started with development <a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> seems like old school as one just needs to download the package and put it on a server and get into coding. While <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> seems to be a little more learning as one needs to get used to <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>. <a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> also has an option to get started using <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> is a full framework having everything to get an application running on server. <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> seems to be a better option to get upto speed with <span class="caps">API</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>development.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>The <a href="https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-19321">second campaign</a> I started just after 5 days of starting my first campaign. Why!? I think this post is more than this <code>why</code> because the <code>why</code> has been answered in my <a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/86/">last post</a>. Hopefully you will enjoy <a href="https://saumya.github.io/ray/articles/86/">that<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>also</a>.</p>
<h3 id="steping-out-of-the-comfort-zone">Steping out of the comfort<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>zone</h3>
<p>While starting this campaign I asked my friends who helped me in my first campaign as to what target should I put. Almost all of them said <code>1000</code> and a few said <code>may be 1500</code>. I was sitting and smiling at the responses. Bacause I knew, it is more than me now who is actully involved in the game. I know for sure that we can achieve between <code>1000</code> and <code>1500</code> this time. But just to keep the gates open and pushing myself to the limit I put it as 5000 in next 30<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>days.</p>
<p>We reached just 25% in this one and that to in the last day<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>itself.</p>
<h3 id="success-in-failure">Success in failure</h3>
<p>That percentage may seem a total disaster, but for me we did a fabulous job. This time, there were just 33 supporters but reached 1000 mark (1255 to be exact)! Comparing to the 44 in the first campaign. And the reach was widened. There are friends who were actively working towards this. Some of them have even posted the links on their Facebook posts and brought in their near and dear<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ones.</p>
<p>To all of my friends who had intended and helped in this, I bow down to you<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>all.</p>

<p>There are friends who pinged me from their side to ask for the donation link. Some friends had their card issues and once those issues were fixed they came back asking for the links. Some of these people have donated twice, once for the first campaign and one for this one! The surprises continue as the days<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>pass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who live almost from hand to mouth, had donated 5 trees! People who have their own house and multiple cars have donated 1<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It clearly showed me that having more money does not guaranty bigger donation. Just keep on spreading the word and those who are willing will join in. This is <a href="https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-19321">the campaign</a> that I am talkng about<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here.</p>
<p>The campaigns are still going on for <a href="https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling">Cauvery Calling</a> üôè and if you wish, you can start your own campaign or donate some tress<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>üôè. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

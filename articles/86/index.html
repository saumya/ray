          <section class="content"><p>I have never thought I could do a fundraising campaign. I had a believe that even if I could start, it would be a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>failure. </p>
<h3 id="the-problem-is-mind">The problem is <strong><code>MIND</code></strong>!</h3>
<h3 id="lol-i-am-serious-before-even-starting-a-thing-the-mind-projects-it-as-a-failure-to-the-level-that-one-must-not-even-try"><span class="caps">LOL</span>. I am serious. Before even starting a thing, the mind projects it as a failure to the level that one must not even<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>try.</h3>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>However, to make myself clear about my assumptions I thought I will try it out. With all these in my mind, I started a campaign to raise funds for 1000 trees in 30 days, where each tree is 42 <span class="caps">INR</span>. While I was not sure where to go next, just logged into Facebook and thought would start from there. After all, no where to go and I can see if I have friends who can be of real help! Again the fear was there because I do not have a lot of friend counts in Facebook either, comparing to people having 1000s in numbers. However I pinged some and waited for a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reply.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the day one, I almost had no hope. No one responded and those who responded they said <code>will see it later</code>. That answer is <code>no</code> for sure, those who know the modern day vocabulary of so called educated. With that I went to bed thinking <code>well, I knew it</code>, I can not do<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it.</p>
<p>Second day I thought I will try it for sometime and then just leave it. After all, I am not capable and people are not ready to donate. And if at all, why they will donate to my campaign! I logged in to Facebook and to my surprise many of the friends, who said <code>will see it later</code> had asked me about the details of the project and the <code>donation link</code>! At that point I knew, there is no going back for me<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>now. </p>
<h3 id="done-in-4-days-with-44-supporters">Done in 4 days with 44<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>supporters.</h3>
<p>Wow! I was suprised as how people are willing to help. Some friends do not even ask for the cause! As I ask them ‚ÄúCan you donate for me?‚Äù, straightaway they asked ‚ÄúHow?! Give your account number?‚Äù Thanking all of you for being there. This does not mean there are no backfire from people. There were some <code>very very rude</code> and <code>negative</code> responses. But the thing is despite of all those, I made<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>it. </p>

<p>I think the points below are the basics for a successful Fundraising<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be a real solution for a real<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>problem.</li>
<li>Leadership must have worked upon the questions supposed to be asked and ready with the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>answers.</li>
<li>Put a time constraint and go all in. The one which I thought is a problem ‚Äúthe time‚Äù is actually a great tool to keep one<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>focused.</li>
<li>Never go into conclusion too early. People will respond. There are many reasons why they might not respond early. So<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>persevere.</li>
<li>Make some authentic friends rather than the number game in Facebook or WhatsApp or in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>general.     </li>
</ul>
<p>What I found is <code>three questions</code> pattern. People will ask basically 3 questions, if they want to donate. If they are going to 3<span class="ord">rd</span> question, <del>it is not that they will not donate</del> then they will not donate <code>now</code>. May be later they will contribute. There is no point in spending more time with them <code>now</code>, if you want to finish the campaign in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>time. </p>
<p>The questions are</p>
<ol>
<li>Where is the link to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>donate?</li>
<li>What is the project<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>about?</li>
<li>How do you know it is not<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>fake?!          </li>
</ol>
<p>The questions will come together but in that order. I mean those who will be asking the second question must have asked the first question. So people who will be asking question 3, have already asked question 1 and then question 2 and have heard answers to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>both.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-people-who-will-not-say-no-directly-they-come-and-abuse-you-personally-in-a-manner-as-if-they-are-caring-for-you">There are people who will not say ‚Äúno‚Äù directly. They come and abuse you personally in a manner as if they are caring for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>you!</h3>
<p>Be very careful not to get engaged with them. Else you will be loosing the time in hand. So the time limit is very necessary to keep you<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>focused.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending upon how you are friends, some will direclty ask for the <code>donation link</code>. They just have to give because of you, no matter what! So it is your duty to provide them with information about the cause. These are the people who might start their own campaign! Some of the donors to my campaign have started their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>own. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some friends will ask the second question. My suggestion is never ever answer from your own mind. The leadership should have answered this already. In my case it did. So I went ahead and provided them with the links to the videos where the questions are answered. I bow down to <code>the leadership</code> for the answers. As soon as people saw the videos, thy are ready to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>donate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer to the third question is, provide them with some more videos from the leadership. They should be convinced. Show them the panel of people involved. Show them the support from the masses. Fortunately for me all of these are available in terms of Youtube videos. I do not have to do anything else except providing them with the right links to the videos. And after all these if they still are not sure then leave them there. Please do not force them at<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now if someone goes for the next question, please run. Yes, time is limited and you can not spend more time here. No matter what,<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an experience! I never thought I will cross even 50 tress. Like it is said, it seems impossible until it is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>done. </p>
<p>In the course of all this I talked with friends, with whom I had not talked in years! I had almost talked with friends all across the planet. For some I used to think I just know them in Facebook! I never knew they have such a strong connection with me! This is another experience I have, that distance does not matter. If you have an authentic connection, it really<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>works.</p>
<p>It can be done with just an internet connection and Facebook. Here I am, 4 days and 44 supporters away, done with 1000 trees. <a href="https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-12287">This is the campaign</a> that I am talking about<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here.</p>
<p>Well, I had started another campaign just to make sure that I can make it, the first one might be an accident! That is another<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>story.</p>
<p>The campaigns are still going on for <a href="https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling">Cauvery Calling</a> üôè and if you wish, you can start your own campaign or donate some tress<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>üôè. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

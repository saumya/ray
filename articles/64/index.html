          <section class="content"><p>The beauty of <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is it now has a lot to offer and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> is just an amazing way to create native mobile applications with Javascript or more specifically with <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. Yes, we are talking about native applications. Unlike <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> applications do not run inside a webview. These applications use the native components from the environment it is running in. If its running in iOS the components like buttons, views etc are real iOS components. Same is true for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Android.</p>
<p>From the first few weeks of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> I must say its worth a try. There might be a chance that even the same code is running in both iOS and Android. Though its almost always a little different code for both the platforms. But all in all, its all<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Javascript.</p>
<p>I am not going in details of getting started here. May be in a next blog post we will explore that. If you are already developing in <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> you are already there. No extra effort for another toolset or<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>language. </p>
<p>Happy Reacting.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>There are a number of reasons to use a specific framework in a work environment. But sometimes it boils down to just the hype. For example in recent past almost all the companies are trying to implement <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and before that time it was the time for <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> and the story goes on like that. It is always a good experience to work in very different kind of framework or for that matter its even better to work in different kind of languages<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>altogether.          </p>
<p>The last year was <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> Toolkit</a> year for me. I must say I am impressed to see features it provides and now that its moving in the right direction. For a long time now, this toolkit was just stagnant but last year only they have started moving again. Well, if you come from a <code>pure Javascript</code> background might not like it by the way it is designed and behaves. The <span class="caps">UI</span> layer of the <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/"><span class="caps">DOJO</span> Toolkit</a> named as Dijit will seem like Flex components (If you know what Flash and Flex is, you will get what I am saying). The framework itself is designed to make people comfortable, who are used to Classical programming languages like <span class="caps">JAVA</span>. The whole toolkit will show itself, as a class based toolkit. The average user will just think and use it as a Classical programming language, which is the root of all evil things in a project. Thats part of the team and how it works with this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>toolkit.          </p>
<p>In general if we talk about the features this toolkit gives us, I would say its nice and efficient if we use it the way it is meant to. The next version is already on progress and they are moving to <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, that a nice move. All in all its a nice experience working with this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>framework.     </p>

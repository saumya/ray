<p>Its a pleasure to use <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for such along time. In fact its the reason I started into blogging. I have a <a href="http://saumyaray.wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> hosted blog till now too. 
This blog was using Wordpress as its blogging engine from 2010 and thats a beautiful engine, I must&nbsp;say.</p>
<p>The reason I moved this to <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a> is, I want to focus on javascript environment now, the same reason was there, with Wordpress. 
I was focusing on <span class="caps">PHP</span> and MySql, those days. So its not that Wordpress is bad but seriously speaking Wordpress is now far beyound a blogging&nbsp;platform.</p>

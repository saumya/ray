          <section class="content"><p>Finished a project having database, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and web <span class="caps">UI</span>. While connecting the database from <code>Node</code> server is easy, there are as usual a lot of options here. First I used <a href="https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#install">mysql</a> but soon after realised there is an updated package to it called <a href="https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#installation">mysql2</a>. So I have shifted to <a href="https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2#installation">mysql2</a>. Once its installed, it is straight forward to connect to any database. The docs are very helpful to get<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>going.</p>
<p>Once database connection is done and one get used to the workflow, the need for an <code>ORM</code> arises. There are many options for this in <code>Node</code> land. After looking into different options, I started using <a href="https://sequelize.org/">Sequelize</a>. It is as nice as <code>Node</code> itself and the docs of this library is very helpful and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>welcoming.</p>
<p>These two things makes life a lot easier, while working with database from a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> server. Next comes the time to write APIs for the frontend. I used <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> to get things done for the APIs. There is one thing to keep in mind while working with <span class="caps">JSON</span> for the APIs in <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>. The thing is one has to initialise <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> application like<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<pre><code>    const express = require(&#39;express&#39;);
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;
    app.use(express.json());
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));</code></pre><p>Once this is done, we are ready to take/give <span class="caps">JSON</span> from/to <span class="caps">UI</span>. If you are trying to host it on Heroku, then the following line is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>important.</p>
<pre><code> app.listen( process.env.PORT || port , () =&gt; console.log(`My App listening!`) );</code></pre><p>This is required because, Heroku does not listen on port 3000 as we are trying to make it. But Heroku port is available for us at <code>process.env.PORT</code>. So we are using it<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here.</p>
<p>Next is making the APIs <span class="caps">CORS</span> enabled. Which is done as<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<pre><code>    app.use(function (req, res, next) {
        res.setHeader(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39;, &#39;http://localhost:1234&#39;);
        res.setHeader(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&#39;, &#39;GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE&#39;);
        res.setHeader(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&#39;, &#39;X-Requested-With,content-type, Accept&#39;);
        res.setHeader(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&#39;, true);
        next();
    });</code></pre><p>Now we are ready to write the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>APIs. </p>
<h3 id="front-end">Front End</h3>
<p>The frontend I have done, is using <a href="https://bulma.io/">bulma</a> for <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for <span class="caps">DOM</span> manipulation. Well yes, I hava avoided all the frameworks and new toys of today. And still could do the project and finish it. I have iterated it a lot and it is all fun to see how time could be saved even if one does not use a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>framework! </p>
<p>Here are the code repositories to have a look for frontend and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>backend.  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/saumya/attendance_ui">Frontend</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/saumya/NodeOrmApi_102">Backend</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is a very nice experience to see Javascript in all sides and almost no framework on frontend and still having a decent project<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>running.</p>

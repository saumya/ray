          <section class="content"><p>It is a surprise for me, to see the processes these companines follow to get a person on board. I am not talking about interview. The technical interview is kind of rounds after rounds of never ending interviews. But at least, these are ok-ish situation for a tech person.<br>The real pain starts, once you get through the interview. Now you are selected and need to serve the notice period at old organisation and move on to join the new one. The problem is, once you are through the interview, this new companies will call you at least 5 times a day. This is plain and simple irritating. They will force you (no one can force you, but at least they will talk like that) to join before the scheduled time. 
If at all, you have joined them by keeping their words, there would be no respect at all for that. Once you come to join them, they will show how much process they follow! Really?!! If you follow all these, why you kept on calling a person who has not joined you? Where were your processes! Or is that a process of yours to trouble someone, who is not from your organisation! Simple stupid. So you make your own process, follow your own process and change that at will.<br>Well, just keep in mind that once you have come to join a new corporate, keep below things with you. These companies will not tell you, when they should have, that please bring all these with&nbsp;you.     </p>
<ol>
<li>Your own laptop (only windows with Internet&nbsp;Explorer)</li>
<li>Your own datacard for&nbsp;internet</li>
<li>Your phone with rooming&nbsp;activated   </li>
</ol>
<p>Once these are done, keep below things with&nbsp;you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your cheque&nbsp;book</li>
<li>Your father’s identity&nbsp;proof</li>
<li>All your previous residing locations&nbsp;proof</li>
<li>Two friends’ addresses and contact from each of all previous location and&nbsp;company</li>
<li>Two local friends’ contacts and addresses (if they are not, create them&nbsp;!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Well last but most importantly keep “your common sense and simplicity” at home. Just rember that these are just mindless machines working for a factory which does not have and can not respect to have a&nbsp;brain.</p>
<p>Never&nbsp;giveup.</p>

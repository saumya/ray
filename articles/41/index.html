          <section class="content"><p>To begin with, <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a> or simply referred to as <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> is one of many libraries in javascript. First thing to do is, like any other javascript libraries, make sure which version of library you are studying and using. <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> has gone through major upgrades and if you are trying to do things the new way of <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> then better get to know the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/modern_dojo/">new version</a>. We will be focusing on the new version only(currently <code>1.10</code>) and referring to old one, wherever<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>necessary.</p>
<p><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a> has got a combination<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>following</p>
<ul>
<li>A bare bone of functionality ( <code>dojo</code> )</li>
<li>A widget library ( <code>dijit</code> )</li>
<li>An experimental library ( <code>dojox</code> )</li>
<li>An Unit testing<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>framework</li>
<li>A compiler to do the minification and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>optimisation</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of javascript libraries try to implement the classical programming concepts and <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> is another one of them. So, if you are a purist in Javascript, <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> will dissapoint you. The functional nature of Javascript is also eliminated here. <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> clearly disagrees to say that <code>function</code> is <code>a first class citizen</code>, which is again denying another nice feature of javascript. Well, but if you are coming from a classical programming background, that means from a programming language which is class based like Java, then <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> will seem natural. So, we will refer them in classical terms rather than Javascript<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>terms.</p>
<p>The core functionality of the toolkit is wrapped in a package called <code>dojo</code>. Everythig that runs in the toolkit depends on this basic package. Next is <code>dijit</code>, which can be called as a component library or in dojo’s terms these are widgets. Now <code>dojox</code> is a package containing experimental widgets, which will eventually go into <code>dijit</code> , once they are stable enough. Since widgets have to live a life of their own, there is a flow of lifecycle events. It is now obvious that any application using these widgets have to abide to these lifecycle events and some rules as a whole. In Dojo’s terms these are framework<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rules.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>

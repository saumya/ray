          <section class="content"><p>This is a situation when you have updated the <span class="caps">OS</span> from a previous version of Mac OSX to the latest version of the OSX Mavericks. Generally OSX ships with a version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, which is latest by the time the <span class="caps">OS</span> is released. But when it comes to OSX upgrade and in this case particularly to OSX Mavericks, the operating system upgrade does not bring in the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> upgrade. Rather, the old <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> lives on the new <span class="caps">OSX</span>. Well, if you have a decent understanding of managing <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> versions, you may be using one of the version management systems of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. I used to have <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. Now I have an upgraded <span class="caps">OSX</span> but need to have the latest version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. The steps are as&nbsp;below     </p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a></li>
<li>Upgrade <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Well, there are issues with these two steps as I found throughout the net. A simple search in the internet will make you aware of this fact. So the refined steps are as&nbsp;below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install XCode Commandline&nbsp;tools</li>
<li>Reinstall <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a></li>
<li>Upgrade <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In my case, I do not have to install the XCode commandline tools, probably because I am an iOS developer and always updates to the latest version of XCode along with the commandline tools. The thing to note here is with the <span class="caps">OSX</span> upgrade, the commandline tools of XCode is removed by the system. Even if, one installs the new <code>XCode</code>, the <code>commandline tools</code> are not included by default. All one has to do is <code>install</code> it (<code>again</code>).<br>Moving on, the next step is to upgrade the <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. With the <span class="caps">OSX</span> upgrade, the normal <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a> update does not&nbsp;work.</p>
<pre><code>rvm get stable
</code></pre><p>So, the fix is to <code>install rvm</code> (you can call it <code>again</code>) as&nbsp;below.</p>
<pre><code>\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
</code></pre><p>Once this step is done everything else is just normal <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> update thing. Update <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> with the commad as&nbsp;below.</p>
<pre><code>rvm install ruby-2.1.1
</code></pre><p>Now lets install a gem such as json, which can be done with the command as follows. I was suggesting <del>sudo gem install json</del>, but never do that. Instead&nbsp;use</p>
<pre><code>gem install json
</code></pre><p>It seems using <code>sudo</code> <code>is not advisable</code> to be used while using <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>. I got a reply in twitter for this blog post, from <a href="https://twitter.com/rvm_io">@rvm_io</a>&nbsp;as </p>
<blockquote>
<p>looks good, the only hint - never use sudo with <span class="caps">RVM</span>, sudo “disables” RVM controlled ruby, the gem most likely is installed in&nbsp;system    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thats all to it. The important thing is, if we try to install the 2.x version of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> with old <a href="http://rvm.io/">rvm</a>, it will not work. Actually, it does not show even in the known list of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;upgrading.</p>

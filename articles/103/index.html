          <section class="content"><p>As a programmer, there are a lot of good things out there. It is the best time to make a choice when you have a lot of choices to make from. There might just be the language of your choice, may be a framework of your choice, may be a toolchain of your choice.<span class="more"></p>
<p><img src="/ray/articles/89/saumya_2019_review.jpg" alt="Reflection"></p>
<p>It is a pity that people suffer choices. They always wanted to choose, but in the end they go with the masses and convince themselves that “they want it”. However as I see it, the programming languages have really matured. <code>There is a language of that kind.</code> No matter if you are a <span class="caps">OOP</span> person or a Functional person, in the backend or frontend, there is a language to your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>choice.</p>
<p>Towards the later part of the last year <code>2020</code>, I was thinking of diving into some new programming languages. I went through a lot of online documents, videos and code samples. The things that interest me<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>were</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These three seemed to me as a nice team. After learning the basics and done some quick applications with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. I am kind of thinking, why I did not found the language earlier! It is small and does the job. With <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> it is similar feeling. A lot could be done with the kind of simplicity and roboustness these langugages provide. On the frontend <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> is a nice tool to experiment<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>with.</p>
<p>Done some <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/">Php</a> for an Android development project. I did a small project to see, how it works. Seems <a href="https://www.php.net/">Php</a> has come a long way. One can write pure Functional programming in <a href="https://www.php.net/">Php</a>. This is just amazing as <code>how simple</code> it all has become to achieve the complex of<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>things.</p>
<p>Though there is a lot of noise around <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, I do not think it can be handled at the same time. But that does not keep me away from that. Whenever I could, will jump into <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> to see how far I could swim in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>there.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>

<p>It is becoming obvious that we need tools for people. Read that<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>again. </p>
<p>Currently the situation is, we make tools for organisations / corporates and may be government. But the root is people and somewhere in this busy train, the importance of <code>individual people</code> are lost. Fortunately the world has a lot of passionate people who care about people. Everyday there are better softwares made for the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>people. </p>
<p>Here is a software to make people host there own <code>Instagram</code> kind of photo sharing application in their own server. This is simple. It requires to upload the folder to the server and done. No server configuration, no database<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>setup.</p>
<p>I call it <code>Minstagram</code>.</p>
<p>The code is as simple as it can be. Where I can see a lot of features are possible arround it, focused on simplicity and usability. Many does require an option to host their images. There are a lot of options available. However every option seems to grown out of its original goal and made things<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>complex.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/saumya/Minstagram">Minstagram</a> is free from any kind of frameworks till now. Neither serverside not client side. No <span class="caps">PHP</span> framweork, no javascript framework. Works on all modern browsers including mobile browsers. However, frontend code and backend code are separate. There is always a call from the javascript to the <span class="caps">PHP</span> for doing something in the server. Which means, one can simply re-write the frontend or re-write the backend without really breaking the other one. That said, Frameworks may be get added in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>future.</p>
<p>Happy Sharing.</p>

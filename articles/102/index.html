          <section class="content"><p>Android application development has come a long way since its beginning. There are different ways to do things now and new capabilities are coming in.<span class="more"></p>
<p><img src="/articles/102/89/saumya_2019_review.jpg" alt="Reflection"></p>
<p>While talking about the ways it was done, the major thing that changed is the language itself from Java to Kotlin. Then the <span class="caps">IDE</span> has moved to <span class="caps">IDEA</span> instead of Eclipse. AndroidStudio is matured enough and the process seems a lot easier than dealing with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Eclipse. </p>
<p>We can do much more with much less<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>pain. </p>
<h3 id="the-app-icon">The App Icon</h3>
<p>Creating an icon for the application was a challenge. Not in terms of design. But one had to make it for a lot of sizes and then put it inside the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>application. </p>
<p>Now one AppIcon is not a single image! One is for background image and one is for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>foreground.</p>
<p>That may seem as more trouble, but in reality, AndroidStudio does the job. Jut remember to add the Image asset and choose the default naming convention. The <span class="caps">IDE</span> will generate different images and overrides the default one. This is true for both the images for the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>icon.</p>
<h3 id="webapp-with-back-button">WebApp with Back<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>button</h3>
<p>Letâ€™s talk about the Web applications inside Android Application. We could do that by pointing a WebView to a <span class="caps">URL</span>. While that was true, one had to do a lot of things to make the hardware <code>Back Button</code> work as a browser back button for that WebView. It always was a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>challenge.</p>
<p>Now, this is much more easier. The WebView itself has matured and it has <span class="caps">API</span> to do things like that. One has to just set the right parameters to enable history of the WebView and call the history <span class="caps">API</span>. If the Web application is done with a <span class="caps">UI</span> which matches the Native Android application, it just feels and works as a native<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>application.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>
